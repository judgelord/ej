Drawing on quantitative data, archival work, and elite interviews, we review empirical support for this model and find that the evidence for its claims is weak relative to the theory’s pervasive influence. We find, first, that the strongest collective action claims appear empirically unsubstantiated in many important climate politics cases. Second, collective action claims—whether in their strongest or in more nuanced versions—appear observationally equivalent to alternative theories focused on distributive conflict within countries. We argue that extant patterns of climate policy making can be explained without invoking free-riding. Governments implement climate policies regardless of what other countries do, and they do so whether a climate treaty dealing with free-riding has been in place or not. Without an empirically grounded model for global
                    climate policy making, institutional and political responses to climate change may ineffectively target the wrong policy-making dilemma. We urge scholars to redouble their efforts to analyze the empirical linkages between domestic and international factors shaping climate policy making in an effort to empirically ground theories of global climate politics. Such analysis is, in turn, the topic of this issue’s special section.}",

abstract = {While the science-policy interface has been a major focus of recent climate policy research, the role of agency practices and bureaucratic behavior has been largely overlooked. With a focus on U.S. federal agencies and similar bureaucratic contexts, we review the literature on how administrative decision-making influences the acquisition and application of climate evidence, including information provided by both scientists and stakeholders. We show that administrative procedures (requirements for gathering and analyzing information), agency characteristics (such as mission and institutional design), and bureaucrat attributes (an individual’s expertise and values) shape agencies’ use of climate evidence. Given the key role of the administrative state in policymaking, our review calls for greater attention to public administration and its consequences for climate responsiveness.}

 abstract = {Using a vast swath of data spanning the past six decades,Unequal Democracydebunks many myths about politics in contemporary America, using the widening gap between the rich and the poor to shed disturbing light on the workings of American democracy. Larry Bartels shows the gap between the rich and poor has increased greatly under Republican administrations and decreased slightly under Democrats, leaving America grossly unequal. This is not simply the result of economic forces, but the product of broad-reaching policy choices in a political system dominated by partisan ideologies and the interests of the wealthy.Bartels demonstrates that elected officials respond to the views of affluent constituents but ignore the views of poor people. He shows that Republican presidents in particular have consistently produced much less income growth for middle-class and working-poor families than for affluent families, greatly increasing inequality. He provides revealing case studies of key policy shifts contributing to inequality, including the massive Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 and the erosion of the minimum wage. Finally, he challenges conventional explanations for why many voters seem to vote against their own economic interests, contending that working-class voters have not been lured into the Republican camp by "values issues" like abortion and gay marriage, as commonly believed, but that Republican presidents have been remarkably successful in timing income growth to cater to short-sighted voters.Unequal Democracyis social science at its very best. It provides a deep and searching analysis of the political causes and consequences of America's growing income gap, and a sobering assessment of the capacity of the American political system to live up to its democratic ideals.},

abstract = {Abstract Observers regularly assert that government regulations are captured—meaning the content of the regulation is diverted away from the public interest and toward the interests of regulated industry. I argue that the label of regulatory capture is often applied differently by policy losers than by policy winners. I hypothesize that when an entity is unsuccessful in achieving its goals during regulatory policy making, that entity is more likely to deem the process captured. With data from 41 FDA regulations and guidance documents, I find that—even when provided a common definition—those interest groups engaged in the same rulemaking vary as to whether or not they would categorize the process as captured. Moreover, this variation is negatively associated with whether the entity achieved its policy goals during the rulemaking. These findings imply that scholars ought to reassess capture's occurrence, as well as the political and policy implications attached to its invocation.}

This paper provides an estimate of lobbying expenditures related to climate change legislation in the U.S. Congress from 2000 to 2016. During this time period, over $2 billion was spent on this activity, constituting 3.9% of total lobbying expenditures. Major sectors involved in lobbying were fossil fuel and transportation corporations, utilities, and affiliated trade associations. Expenditures by these sectors dwarf those of environmental organizations and renewable energy corporations. Levels of expenditures on lobbying appear to be related to the introduction and probability of passage of significant climate legislation. Future research should focus on tying particular positions on climate legislation and lobbying expenditures at the corporate level.},

    abstract = { Many scholars have argued that because consumers are poorly organized, regulatory enforcement will tend to be lax and serve the interests of industry. Considering, however, that elections are one of the main mechanisms by which the public exerts control over policy, surprisingly few studies have examined how electoral incentives may spur the government to regulate vigorously on behalf of consumers. We argue that when the threat of electoral accountability is greater, regulatory activities will serve the interests of the public, even if they impose costs on industry. We test this theoretical expectation by analyzing state regulatory activity in the wake of exogenous storms and natural disasters, which provide us with important theoretical and causal leverage. We find that a more “pro-regulation” electorate and elected chief regulators acting in close proximity to elections are associated with pro-consumer regulatory action. }

    abstract = { Scholars have long acknowledged that legislators strategically employ procedure to advance policy preferences. But evidence for this view is confined to the lawmaking process, omitting an essential function of elected representatives: oversight of executive policy making. We argue that ex post procedural oversight is also driven by policy disagreement. We demonstrate this by analyzing congressional participation in US Environmental Protection Agency rulemaking from 2007 to 2017. Using the content of public comments and commenters’ political contributions, our study is the first to locate the spatial position of rulemaking proposals. We find that the more ideologically distant the agency proposal, the more likely a request for documents, additional hearings, or more time for public participation. Moreover, these requests are likely to parallel substantive criticisms and be concentrated among members with experienced staff. These findings imply that—beyond setting the baseline rules of bureaucratic policy making—well-resourced elected officials leverage procedure during policy implementation. }

 abstract = {We present evidence of the kind of governmental processes Americans would like to see in Washington. People believe they have been excluded from current processes, but they do not want direct democracy. The extent to which individuals believe actual processes are inconsistent with their own process preferences is an important variable in understanding the current public mood. Moreover, individual-level differences in level of dissatisfaction with democratic processes help explain variations in public approval of government and in willingness to comply with the outputs of government. Of course, many political attitudes and behaviors are influenced by fondness for the policies that government produces, but it is also the case that sentiments and actions are affected by the way government produces those policies. Far from being merely a means to a policy end, governmental process is important in its own right.},

 abstract = {In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle defined “equity” as the process that intervenes when law fails because of its generality. Equity is largely assumed to be the province of courts and framed primarily as the domain of judges: Should the court apply a general law when its application results in unforeseen or unfortunate consequences? But equity operates outside the courts also. Within legislatures and administrative agencies, equity operates to make general laws more specific, create exceptions, and pass narrowing amendments or regulations. In fact, the lion’s share of equitable work has been done outside the courts for much of this nation’s history. This Article draws on these histories to expand the field within which equity is identified to include legislatures and agencies. By contrast to the court-centered functional account of “equity,” equity outside the courts is a dynamic and discursive practice—not simply a process—that members of the public engage in as they lobby or petition for exceptions or amendments to general laws—either new or previously proposed or passed. Because these institutions aim to be “representative,” equity within legislatures and agencies has fulfilled a representative function and has allowed marginalized and subordinated groups to shape law and shift power. Yet, seeking equity often pushes laws toward specificity and away from the ideal of generality identified by Lon Fuller and others—thereby raising rule of law concerns. A less court-centered account of equity teaches that the generality principle might overlook equity’s representational function—integral when making law to govern plural jurisdictions.}

    abstract = { Due to inconsistent concepts of regulatory stringency, scholars offer conflicting accounts about whether competing private governance initiatives “race to the bottom,” “ratchet up,” “converge,” or “diverge.” To remedy this, we offer a framework for more systematic comparisons across programs and over time. We distinguish three often-conflated measures of stringency: regulatory scope, prescriptiveness, and performance levels. Applying this framework, we compare competing U.S. forestry certification programs, one founded by environmental activists and their allies, the other by the national industry association. We find ‘upwardly divergent’ policy prescriptiveness: both programs increased in prescriptiveness, but this increase was greater for the activist-backed program. Furthermore, requirements added by the activist-backed program were more likely to impose costs on firms than requirements added by the industry-backed program, many of which may even benefit firms. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that industry-backed programs emphasize less costly types of stringency than activist-backed programs. They also reveal patterns of change that previous scholarship failed to anticipate, illustrating how disentangling types of stringency can improve theory building and testing. }

These works, however, have often focused on the influence of individual groups rather than coalitional efforts, which compose the majority of lobbying. Assessing this activity is critical to understanding the role of public participants in administrative policymaking. I test the influence of diverse coalitions of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs by analyzing a new dataset of organizations’ co-signed public comments across nearly 350 federal agency rules proposed between 2005 and 2015. I find that agencies favor recommendations from organizationally diverse coalitions, and not coalitions that are bipartisan or dominated by business interests. Further, I find that coalition influence is heightened when lobbying in coalitions that are larger in size and more well-resourced, and when policy salience is low. I conclude that diverse lobbying coalitions help bureaucrats to shape the direction and content of regulatory law. This conclusion further establishes the role of organizational participants in bureaucratic policymaking and contributes to the debate over democratic legitimacy in the administrative state.}

Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation, for example, continues to receive invitations to help organize low income communities because of its ability to mobilize poor people around the tactic of protest.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding of the phenomenon of political protest has been inhibited by the view that protest is fundamentally extraordinary or unconventional in character and that those who use it do so because they lack the resources to employ more conventional means of political expression. This article challenges this unqualified view by examining survey data based on black and white samples from the city of Milwaukee which relate to racial attitudes toward protest, the social characteristics of protest participants, and to the uses and organization of protest in the two racial communities. The analysis reveals widespread support for protest in the black community in contrast to the general antipathy found among whites. Both black and white protesters are found to be socioeconomically better-off than nonprotesters in their respective racial communities, but a variety of indicators suggest that black protesters are more integrated and typical members of their community than white protesters are of theirs. Data on the uses and organization of protest show that it has become an institutionalized feature of the black pursuit of urban politics in Milwaukee in contrast to its generally ad hoc and less frequent role for whites.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Democracy in America emerged not
merely through elections and parties, but through the
transformation of an ancient political tool: the petition. A
statement of grievance accompanied by a list of signatures, the
petition afforded women and men excluded from formal politics the
chance to make their voices heard and to reshape the landscape of
political possibility. Democracy by Petition traces the
explosion and expansion of petitioning across the North American
continent. Indigenous tribes in Canada, free Blacks from Boston to
the British West Indies, Irish canal workers in Indiana, and
Hispanic settlers in territorial New Mexico all used petitions to
make claims on those in power. Petitions facilitated the extension
of suffrage, the decline of feudal land tenure, and advances in
liberty for women, African Americans, and Indigenous peoples. Even
where petitioners failed in their immediate aims, their campaigns
advanced democracy by setting agendas, recruiting people into
political causes, and fostering aspirations of equality. Far more
than periodic elections, petitions provided an everyday current of
communication between officeholders and the people. The coming of
democracy in America owes much to the unprecedented energy with
which the petition was employed in the antebellum period. By
uncovering this neglected yet vital strand of nineteenth-century
life, Democracy by Petition will forever change how we
understand our political history.

abstract = {The petition is one of the most consequential institutions of republican government. Yet
considerable historical evidence suggests that petitions are routinely ignored by the legislatures and
executives who receive them, raising the question of why petitioning flourishes when the credibility
and authority of the petition is often minimal. In this speculative essay I interpret the petition as the
historical solution to a recruitment problem faced by activists building new political organizations in
network-rich but information-poor environments. Essentially, the list of signa tories accompanying a
petition is a rich political resource. For the recruiter, the petition's signatory list (1) identifies
individuals sympathetic to its prayer, (2) locates those individuals (implicitly or explicitly) in a social
structure, and (3) fosters new networks in the process of gathering signatures. For the citizen, the
list indicates who and how many have assented to the petition's prayer. I assess this account of the
petition in an analysis of a sample of 3,915 antislavery petitions to the House of Representatives
from the 25th Congress (1837-1839). Several stylized features of these petitions – repeat signatories,
the abundance of non-voting signatories, the preponderance of door-to-door canvassing, copied
signatures, and the transmission of petitions to legislators out of the petitioners' district – cohere
roughly with a mobilizing interpretation. I also present preliminary evidence that the cross-county
distribution of 1830s petitions from New York anticipates (1) the growth of American Anti-Slavery
Society chapters and (2) antislavery party voting in the 1840s in a way that other variables cannot.
The essay concludes that the abolitionists' petition drive was as much a method of mobilization as
an expression of public sentiment. My interpretation suggests that the most important readers of a
petition are its signatories, and raises the possibility that the petition can be politically consequential
even when it is known to be ignored by its intended recipient.},

@article{Walters2019a,
abstract = { outside interests shape the rulemaking agenda. A great deal of skepticism toward regulation stems from the widespread perception that agencies excessively, or even exclusively, cater
to business interests. One answer to these concerns is administrative procedure, in particular
rulemaking petitions, which are provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act and in
many substantive environmental statutes. Although rulemaking petitions could in theory be
used by business interests to strengthen their hold on regulatory agenda-setting, a growing
number of scholars, highlighting the critical role a rulemaking petition played in the Supreme
Court's 2007 decision forcing EPA action on climate change, have pointed to the potential for
rulemaking petitions to combat agency inaction and under-regulation. Despite these warring
descriptions, we actually have very little generalizable understanding of how rulemaking petitions operate in practice and to whom the benefits of the institution flow.
In this Article, I take a close look at original data on all the rulemaking petitions submitted to three administrative agencies from 2000 to 2016, statistically tracing petitions' fates
from submission to resolution. I find that, although business interests may participate at a
higher rate than public interest groups and individuals, there is little evidence of full-on regulatory capture via petitions. Even in a venue where it would be exceedingly easy to give
business interests precisely what they want, agencies remain largely unmoved and evenhanded. The pattern that does emerge—an agency preference for using petitions to inform
incremental revision and softening of existing regulations to reflect changed circumstances or
new technologies—probably does inure mostly to the benefit of regulated entities, but it is
difficult to square these findings with theories of excessive influence or capture of the regulatory
process by business interests. At the same time, the findings pour cold water on the more
sanguine account of petitions as a tool to advance environmental regulation. Despite the allure
of such an account after Massachusetts v. EPA, the reality is that petitions are rarely transformative and will remain so unless significant changes are made to the institution.},

abstract = {An increasing number of states have adopted laws that require voters to show photo identification to vote. We show that the deterrent effect of strict ID laws on turnout persists even after the laws are repealed. To assess the persistent effect of ID laws on turnout we leverage administrative data from North Carolina and a photo ID law that was in effect for a primary election, but not the subsequent general election. Using exact matching and a difference-indifferences design, we show that the photo ID law caused a 1 percentage point turnout decrease for voters without a North Carolina ID law in the primary election. After the law was suspended this effect persisted: those without an ID were 2.6 percentage points less likely to turnout in the general election. The general election effect is robust to a variety of alternative explanations and we show is consistent with aggregate analyses that find a null effect of voter ID laws. Our results suggest that photo ID laws' deterrent effect persists because voters lack information about the changing requirements for voting, creating confusion that keeps them from voting.},

This paper explains the lobbying success of these industries in terms of the strategic role of investment as a credible commitment device. It is demonstrated that if governments are predisposed to special interest groups, underinvestment in new technology enables firms to lobby more effectively. Such industries are shown to be better placed to extract policy concessions, despite contributing less to the government in political donations. The analysis therefore suggests that political considerations may provide a significant incentive for firms to reject environmentally beneficial investments, even when these lower production costs.},

@article{Lattimore2019,
abstract = {The concept of causality has a controversial history. The question of whether it is possible to represent and address causal problems with probability theory, or if fundamentally new mathematics such as the do-calculus is required has been hotly debated, e.g. [Pearl, 2001] states 'the building blocks of our scientific and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as "mud does not cause rain" and "symptoms do not cause disease" and those facts, strangely enough, cannot be expressed in the vocabulary of probability calculus'. This has lead to a di-chotomy between advocates of causal graphical modeling and the do-calculus, and researchers applying Bayesian methods. In this paper we demonstrate that, while it is critical to explicitly model our assumptions on the impact of intervening in a system, provided we do so, estimating causal effects can be done entirely within the standard Bayesian paradigm. The invari-ance assumptions underlying causal graphical models can be encoded in ordinary Probabilistic graphical models, allowing causal estimation with Bayesian statistics, equivalent to the do-calculus. Elucidating the connections between these approaches is a key step toward enabling the insights provided by each to be combined to solve real problems.},

Specifically, the notions of a monotonic effect, a weak monotonic effect and a signed edge are introduced. Results are developed relating these monotonic effects and signed edges to the sign of the causal effect of an intervention in the presence of intermediate variables. The incorporation of signed edges into the directed acyclic graph causal framework furthermore allows for the development of rules governing the relationship between monotonic effects and the sign of the covariance between two variables. It is shown that when certain assumptions about monotonic effects can be made then these results can be used to draw conclusions about the presence of causal effects even when data is missing on confounding variables.},

In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference.

@article{Gelman2014,
abstract = {You have just finished running an experiment. You analyze the results, and you find a significant effect. Success! But wait-how much information does your study really give you? How much should you trust your results? In this article, we show that when researchers use small samples and noisy measurements to study small effects-as they often do in psychology as well as other disciplines-a significant result is often surprisingly likely to be in the wrong direction and to greatly overestimate an effect. In this article, we examine some critical issues related to power analysis and the interpretation of findings arising from studies with small sample sizes. We highlight the use of external information to inform estimates of true effect size and propose what we call a design analysis a set of statistical calculations about what could happen under hypothetical replications of a study-that focuses on estimates and uncertainties rather than on statistical significance. As a reminder, the power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis. For any experimental design, the power of a study depends on sample size, measurement variance, the number of comparisons being performed, and the size of the effects being studied. In general, the larger the effect, the higher the power; thus, power calculations are performed conditionally on some assumption of the size of the effect. Power calculations also depend on other assumptions, most notably the size of measurement error, but these are typically not so difficult to assess with available data. It is of course not at all new to recommend the use of statistical calculations on the basis of prior guesses of effect sizes to inform the design of studies. What is new about the present article is as follows: 1. We suggest that design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection and analysis. Abstract Statistical power analysis provides the conventional approach to assess error rates when designing a research study. However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

Thus, managing BMFS requires that one should combine multiple institutional logics, consider different stakeholders, and integrate distinct value dimensions. While research into BMFS has proposed frameworks and tools to capture this complexity, the mechanisms that underlie the interaction of the economic with social and/or ecological value creation cycles in BMFS remain unknown. We use a longitudinal, multiple-case study approach to identify a framework of fundamental choices and consequences that lead to economic and social/ecological value creation. Our findings highlight the interdependence of a set of three fundamental choices (an ambition to cater for multiple purposes, behavioral consistency, and collaboration) that lead to a virtuous circle of reinforcing consequences and cascaded value creation. Furthermore, we show how acceptance of limitations and restrictions functions as a powerful coping mechanism to deal with paradox tensions.},

For either an industry association or an NGO sponsor in autarky, binary labels are preferred when a large enough share of producers have a low cost of quality and when cost heterogeneity across firms is limited ; multitier labels are preferred when a large enough share of producers have a high cost of quality and when cost heterogeneity is substantial. The NGO implements welfare-maximizing standards under certain conditions; the industry never does. When sponsors with differing objectives compete, the unique equilibrium involves multitier labels, with less environmental protection than the NGO in autarky would provide. The multitier equilibrium is robust to endogenous entry by producers. JEL Codes: D82, L15, L31, Q50},

abstract = {Scholarly and managerial interest in corporate sustainability has increased significantly in the past two decades. However, the field is increasingly criticized for failing to effectively contribute to sustainable development and for its limited impact on managerial practice. We argue that this criticism arises due to a fundamental ambiguity around the nature of corporate sustainability. To address the lack of concept clarity, we conduct a systematic literature review and identify 33 definitions of corporate sustainability. Adopting the Aristotelian perspective on definitions, one that promotes reducing concepts to their essential attributes, we discern four components of corporate sustainability. These components offer a conceptual space of inquiry that, while being parsimonious, offers nuanced understanding of the dimensions along which definitions of corporate sustainability differ. We discuss implications for research and practice and outline several recommendations for how advancements in construct clarity may lead to a better scholarly understanding of corporate sustainability.},

Our study is the first to uncover the network structure of this system, based on a dataset that includes 61 transna-tional CSR schemes and 31,987 firms. We demonstrate that the network exhibits a significant level of cohesiveness, despite having evolved without any form of hierarchical control. Drawing on a social network analysis, we find a positive correlation among the sustainability performance of the firms, their membership in CSR schemes, and their network characteristics. We show that membership in multiple schemes and the firms' position in the CSR-schemes network constitute credible predictors of their sustainability performance, generating a separating equilibrium that distinguishes high from low CSR performers. We develop a model that explains the effectiveness of the CSR-schemes network based on the synergistic properties of the network and on a distinctive signaling dynamic. Our findings highlight the potential contribution of CSR to the resolution of global governance dilemmas.},

We consider here two possible explanations: low levels of effect heterogeneity or high levels of effect heterogeneity that are unrelated to selection into the convenience sample. We analyze subgroup conditional average treatment effects using 27 original-replication study pairs (encompassing 101,745 individual survey responses) to assess the extent to which subgroup effect estimates generalize. While there are exceptions, the overwhelming pattern that emerges is one of treatment effect homogeneity, providing a partial explanation for strong correspondence across both unconditional and conditional average treatment effect estimates.},

However, commonly used experimental manipulations tend to have collateral effects on emotions other than the targeted emotion, making it difficult to ascribe outcomes to any single emotion. In this letter, we propose to address this problem using causal mediation analysis. We illustrate this approach using an experiment examining the effect of emotion on dyadic trust, as measured by the trust game. Our findings suggest that negative emotions can decrease trust, but only if those negative emotions make people feel less certain about their current situation. Our results suggest that only anxiety, a low-certainty emotion, has a negative impact on trust, whereas anger and guilt, two emotions that differ in their control appraisals but induce the same high level of certainty, appear to have no effect on trusting behavior. Importantly, we find that failing to use causal mediation analysis would ascribe a {\textless}italic{\textgreater}positive{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} effect of anxiety on trust, demonstrating the value of this approach. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although rulemaking is an attractive policy-making venue for feminists because it provides them with an opportunity to bypass congressional gridlock and interact with more women policy makers than they might in Congress, the existing literature does not address how and when feminist organizations' participation in rulemaking is influential. To examine this question for the first time, I analyze a sample of the 5,860 comments that the U.S. Department of Education received in response to its 2004 proposed rule allowing for public single-sex education programs and the department's justifications for its proposed and final rules. Specifically, I ask whether findings from the rulemaking literature showing that organizations can encourage bureaucrats to change their proposed rules when they submit large numbers of high-quality, homogenous, opposing comments hold for feminist organizations in a redistributive policy area. The findings indicate that when bureaucrats receive multiple sets of high-quality homogenous comments, they are more likely to side with commenters who support their initial proposals and/or partisan and ideological positions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Leading up to the 2016 election, single women were heralded as the “hot” new constituency. With unmarried women posed to comprise approximately half of the population of adult women and 23{\%} of the electorate (Traister 2016), pundits claimed that the rising number of single women could transform American politics. Building on this recent enthusiasm about single women, this study provides one of the first systematic analyses of how contemporary women's organizations represent single women by analyzing 1,021 comments that women's organizations submitted to rule makers between 2007 and 2013. Using automated text analyses and a series of statistical analyses, it shows that despite the rising numbers of American single women, women's organizations only very rarely explicitly refer to single women during their comment writing campaigns, preferring to highlight the experiences of married mothers instead. Moreover, it shows that the political context unexpectedly has little to no effect on the degree to which women's organizations focus on single women, possibly because they so rarely mention them at all. Altogether, the results suggest that for single women to become politically powerful, they will need more than just large numbers; they may also need niche organizations that can help them organize and articulate their broader policy needs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

But the Trump administration has produced an unprecedented volume of agency actions that blatantly flout settled administrative-law doctrine. This phenomenon, which we term "regulatory slop," requires courts to reinforce the norms of administrative law by adhering to established doctrine and paying careful attention to remedial options. In this Article, we document numerous examples of regulatory slop and canvass how the Trump agencies have fared in court thus far. We contend that traditional critiques of judicial review carry little force in such circumstances. Further, regulatory slop should be of concern regardless of one's political leanings because it threatens the rule of law. Rather than argue for a change to substantive administrative-law doctrine, therefore, we take a close look at courts' remedial options in such circumstances. We conclude that a strong approach to remedies can send corrective signals to agencies that reinforce both administrative-law values and the rule of law.},

It states a partisan theory of legislative subsidy in which members of Congress are inclined to meet with lobbyists when they share a partisan affiliation. It formulates hypotheses that lobbying firms receive greater revenues by being tied to the majority party in Congress and that they are likely to receive greater revenues from being aligned with the House of Representatives than the Senate. These hypotheses are tested using data available under the Lobbying Disclosure Act from 2008 to 2016. Regression analysis reveals that lobbying firms receive financial benefits when they have partisan ties with the majority party in the House but not with the majority party in the Senate. The results indicate that there are greater financial returns to lobbying the House than the Senate. A difference-indifferences analysis establishes that Republican-aligned lobbying firms received a financial windfall when the Republican Party reclaimed the House in 2011 but not when the Republicans reclaimed the Senate in 2015. The outcome of the 2018 midterm congressional election presents another opportunity to test these hypotheses once the 2019 lobbying data become available.},

abstract = {The financial system is governed not just by formal rules but also by social relationships that pervade the elite strata of society. Understanding such dynamics entails understanding complex relational ties between actors, a task that can be facilitated through the use of network analysis. We argue that a latent feature of interest to scholars of the political economy of finance is one of social distance, which is a measurable concept. Using new data from the financial sector, we measure the social distance between a range of financial firms and one key regulator, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), over time to assess whether or not social distance is related to organizations' advocacy behavior. We find a positive relationship between how close a given organization is to the SEC and how often it engages in advocacy. The result persists when we control for numerous factors related to organizational characteristics, firm size, and when we measure advocacy frequency in different ways.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@book{West1995,
abstract = {Although the growth of bureaucracy has accompanied modernization throughout the world, it has been especially unsettling for America's particular system of democracy. American government has adapted to the rise of the administrative state through three, often-conflicting, means of promoting accountability. It has sought to ensure desired qualities in agency decision making through participatory opportunities and standards of rationality that are enforced through the courts. And both the president and Congress have sought to monitor and shape agencies' actions in accordance with their own policy preferences. Each of these controls has received considerable attention, but there are few up-to-date discussions of all three. This book fills that void by providing a balanced overview of the institutional powers and resources associated with administrative due process and executive and legislative oversight at the federal level. 1.

@article{Stack2016,
abstract = {Debates over administrative agencies' reliance on guidance documents have largely neglected the most authoritative source of guidance about the meaning of agency regulations: their preambles. This Article examines and defends the guidance function of preambles. Preambles were designed not only to provide the agency's official justification for the regulations they introduce, but also to offer guidance about the regulation's meaning and application. Today, preambles include extensive guidance ranging from interpretive commentary to application examples. Based on the place of preamble guidance as part of the agency's formal explanation of the regulation and the rigorous internal agency vetting which accompanies that formal role, this Article argues that preamble guidance has greater authority than other forms of guidance. That greater authority has important implications. Under current judicial doctrine, preamble guidance warrants greater deference than other forms of guidance. Preamble guidance's superiority also grounds the agency's obligation to act consistently with it—and to revise preamble guidance only in documents issued by the agency, as opposed to lower-level officials, with the same publicity as the original preamble. This obligation should be expressly adopted as a form of internal administrative law either by individual agencies or central executive branch regulators.

@article{Seidenfeld2011,
abstract = {This article proposes that courts substitute immediate substantive review for procedural review of agency guidance documents. The article begins by reviewing the extensive literature about how courts should treat non-legislative rules. Because such rules play an important role in assuring coherence and accountability of agency policies and interpretations and in communicating the views of agencies about such matters the article agrees with those who advocate ex-post monitoring of agency use of rules issued without notice and comment procedures. Recognizing that ex-post monitoring leaves much leeway for agencies to abuse guidance documents by depriving stakeholders of opportunities to participate in their development and of obtaining substantive judicial review of them, the article advocates that non-legislative rules generally should be subject to arbitrary and capricious review when issued. The article proceeds to explain why other proposals to rein in agency discretion to use guidance documents – in particular making the agency explain its decision to proceed by this mode and forcing the agency to consider timely petitions for reconsideration of such documents – are likely to have less effect with greater cost than its proposal for direct review of guidance documents.

@article{Cook2016,
abstract = {The worries American citizens express about the distorting influence of minority factions, or special interests, on public governance are as old as the republic. I briefly recount the constitutional design flaws and developmental changes that have combined to make these worries more valid than ever in an age of administratively centered governance. I then review the evidence on the nature and extent of special interest influence on the administrative process from a broad swath of scholarship. After noting the limited efficacy of attempts to limit special interest influence via minor tinkering with the separation of powers, I argue for more fundamental structural change in the form of administration as a separate, constitutionally recognized element of the separation of powers. I outline basic structural features and offer hypothetical yet plausible consequences of such a design change. The latter, I contend, are amenable to confirmation or refutation through systematic analysis of evidence that is already available from past and current governing experience. Keywords special interests, administrative power, constitutional redesign During the 1912 campaign for the U.S. presidency, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson engaged in a spirited debate about how the nation should cope with the trusts, those massive corporate combinations that had emerged in the previous two decades and gained control of markets in a host of vital products and services. Roosevelt called for regulating the trusts through a national commission placed in the executive branch because the effort to break up the trusts through the courts had failed. He insisted that regulating rather than dismantling the trusts would ensure that the competitive advantages of their organizational efficiencies would be preserved. Regulating competition rather than regulating the trusts, Wilson countered, was the better strategy. He contended that regulating the trusts by a commission of experts would be tantamount to allowing corporate monopolies to control the government, because most of the expertise for the regulatory commission would come from the regulated entities. Wilson warned against placing unguided discretion in the hands of such experts. Instead, he called for designing the law regulating competition with sufficient specificity and clarity as to limit administrative discretion, which would ensure that law and not the power of monopoly expertise would prevail.},

@article{Mendelson2007,
abstract = {Administrative agencies frequently use guidance documents to set policy broadly and prospectively in areas ranging from Department of Education Title IX enforcement to Food and Drug Administration regulation of direct-to- consumer pharmaceutical advertising. In form, these guidances often closely resemble the policies agencies issue in ordinary notice-and-comment rulemaking. However, guidances are generally developed with little public participation and are often immune from judicial review. Nonetheless, guidances can prompt significant changes in behavior from those the agencies regulate. A number of commentators have guardedly defended the current state of affairs. Though guidances lack some important procedural safeguards, they can help agencies supervise low-level employees and supply valuable information to regulated entities regarding how an agency will implement a program. Thus far, however, the debate has largely ignored the distinct and substantial interests of regulatory beneficiaries--those who expect to benefit from government regulation of others. Regulatory beneficiaries include, among others, pharmaceutical consumers, environmental users, and workers seeking safe workplaces. When agencies make policy informally, regulatory beneficiaries suffer distinctive losses to their ability to participate in the agency's decision and to invoke judicial review. This Article argues that considering the interests of regulatory beneficiaries strengthens the case for procedural reform. The Article then assesses some possible solutions.

The research presented here introduces a new way of measuring lobbying success and lays out a model of its determinants. To understand why interest groups sometimes succeed and at other times fail, we must consider the institutional structure of the political system within which the advocates are operating; the characteristics of the issue at hand; and finally the characteristics of the interest group itself and their lobbying strategy. I test these factors with original data based on interviews with I49 advocates in Washington D.C. and Brussels active on a random sample of 47 policy issues. From the results, issue context emerges as a much more important determinant of lobbying success than institutional differences. The institutional differences that do emerge suggest that direct elections coupled with private campaign finance lead to winner-take-all outcomes biased in favour of wealthier business interests, while the lack of these institutional characteristics leads to more balanced policy compromises with more advocates achieving some of their policy goals.},

Using major developments in administrative law and modifications to FDA's regulatory regime as milestones, the article traces how and why FDA's use of informal guidance to fulfill its statutory mandate has changed over the past century. Along the way, the article identifies important doctrinal questions that persist today, namely (1) whether informal advisory opinions bind FDA and (2) the degree of judicial deference guidance documents should receive under the Supreme Court's decisions in Chevron and Mead. The article attempts to resolve these doctrinal ambiguities. It then undertakes a normative analysis of FDA's increasing reliance on informal guidance, and concludes that, on the whole, this development has benefited FDA's major stakeholders: regulated entities, the general public and the agency itself. The article closes with modest proposals for reform. The article features an appendix with several tables illustrating FDAs output of informal guidance documents by year, to facilitate further study.},

abstract = {The Administrative Procedure Act imposes a general obligation on federal agencies to use notice-and-comment procedures when they adopt rules, but it contains an exemption, {\S} 553(b)(A), for two kinds of rules that lack the force of law-"interpretative rules" and "general statements of policy." Questions pertaining to the application of this exemption may constitute the single most frequently litigated and important issue of rulemaking procedure in the federal courts today. This article undertakes a comprehensive examination of issues presented by the exemption and offers a unified framework for resolving them. The article deals with procedural questions only and does not address judicial review issues pertaining to these rules. The draftsmanship of {\S} 553(b)(A) has generally been read to imply that interpretive rules and policy statements should be analyzed separately for purposes of the exemption, and, indeed, two separate lines of cases have developed. However, the track records of those two bodies of case law have not proved equally satisfactory. The courts' approach to policy statements is essentially coherent-more so than many scholars acknowledge. It revolves around the issue of whether a statement creates a "binding norm," either legally or in practical effect. Much of the case law on policy statements applies the exemption more narrowly than I would endorse, but the tensions in the precedents result from understandable tradeoffs among competing values. Many of those same values are also reflected in best-practices recommendations adopted by government bodies and professional organizations. In contrast, the case law on interpretive rules is highly unsatisfactory. It is generally understood that an interpretive rule explains existing law instead of creating new law. However, the approaches by which courts apply this criterion are not only vague, but also lack credible policy justifications that would enable courts and agencies to find their way past the vagueness.

The federal agency's rulemaking is controversial because of its perceived complexity, lack of transparency, and lengthy duration. To shed light on the FDA's rulemaking process, we examined the evolution of significant rules that the agency published during 2000-12 for drugs, devices, and other medical products. We found that the rules' median time to finalization was 7.3 years, with the pre-rule phase and postreview deliberation within the FDA accounting for the majority of that time. Rules that involved mandatory cost-benefit analyses were associated with an additional delay of approximately two years. We also found that longer review times were significantly associated with a reduction in the stringency of final rules, compared to the originally proposed versions. We recommend improving FDA's rulemaking by allocating additional resources to increase efficiency and by embarking on initiatives to promote transparency by the FDA and other parts of the executive branch.},

abstract = {Administrative law has ceased to respond adequately to the challenges posed by modern-day executive government. We suggest that the discordance reflects a mismatch between the debilities of the Congress and an administrative regime built on legislative supremacy.

Administrative law — in its New Deal and its modern, post-Chevron forms — presuppose a Congress that is jealous of its legislative powers. However, the modern Congress has increasingly dis-empowered itself. It consistently fails to update old statutes even when they are manifestly outdated or, as actually administered, have assumed contours that neither the enacting nor the current Congress would countenance. When Congress does legislate, it tends to enact highly convoluted and often incoherent “hyper-legislation.”

We examine the effects first on agencies, and then on courts and their doctrines. Knowing that there is no turning (back) to Congress, agencies are tempted to improvise policies lacking legislative authority. In turn, administrative law doctrines that were developed under very different institutional conditions start to bend.

We describe three increasingly common forms of agency action: (1) agency “re-writes” of statutes; (2) procedural shell games and manipulation; and (3) broad regulatory waivers without or in excess of a statutory warrant. We provide illustrations in the “old statutes” and “hyper-legislation” settings. Our principal old-statute example is the Clean Air Act and the protracted litigation over the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gases, culminating (for now) in the Supreme Court's decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. Our principal examples of hyper-legislation are the Dodd-Frank Act and the Affordable Care Act, including the pending litigation over the scope of the act's subsidy and mandate provisions.

We conclude with a plea for more institutional realism and less interpretive metaphysics in administrative law.

@unpublished{Graham2015,
abstract = {The federal regulatory system includes two important components, each designed to ensure that the regulatory process works to advance the interests of the American people. First, the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA) compels regulatory agencies to consider the wishes of the American public via a process of public participation in rulemaking. Second, regulatory review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), in place since the early 1980s, provides assurance that a minimal level of evidence, especially economic evidence, is supplied to support agency decisions. Along with judicial review and congressional oversight, these components provide the checks and balances that are the foundation of the modern regulatory state.

Whether intentionally or not, agencies often avoid these procedural requirements. A recent study finds that agencies avoided the notice-and-comment process, which facilitates public participation in rulemaking, in almost 52 percent of regulations finalized from 1995 to 2012. Meanwhile, only about 8 percent of final regulations underwent OIRA scrutiny between fiscal years 2004 and 2013. More troubling, however, is the fact that agencies can evade checks and balances altogether via an array of mechanisms that circumvent or bypass the traditional rulemaking process. This type of under-the-radar rulemaking is known as stealth regulation.

agency implementation; emergency statutes and regulations issued
without prior comment; outsourcing to lawmaking commissions and
unconventional delegates; process shortcuts outside of emergencies;

traditionally part of the core lawmaking and rulemaking processes. These
unorthodoxies are the new textbook process.
The theories and doctrines of legislation and administrative law,
however, have paid little attention to these evolutions. The limited
commentary that does exist tends to lump all unorthodox policymaking
together or to preserve an artificial divide between their legislative and

The article provides a description and analysis of the existing "law" regarding nonlegislative rules adopted by federal administrative agencies, that is, intepretative rules and statements of policy as used in the federal administrative procedure act. This description and analysis includes discussion of how courts determine when a rule is legislative or nonlegislative, what deference courts give to nonlegislative rules, and when preenforcement challenges are ripe for judicial review. The article then addresses the presentations of Professors Peter Strauss and Robert Anthony and Mr. Randy May, in which among other things the article suggests certain problems with Professor Strauss's use of the term "publication rules" in place of nonlegislative rules.

@article{Franklin2010,
abstract = {Courts have long struggled to distinguish legislative rules, which are designed to have binding legal effect and must go through the rulemaking procedure known as notice and comment, from nonlegislative rules, which are not meant to have binding legal effect and are exempted from notice and comment. The distinction has been called "tenuous," "baffling," and "enshrouded in considerable smog." What is just as baffling is that prominent commentators such as John Manning, William Funk, Donald Elliott, and Jacob Gersen have proposed a simple solution to the problem -and courts have failed to take them up on it. Rather than inquiring into a rule's nature or effects to decide whether it must undergo notice and comment, these commentators urge, courts should turn the question inside-out and ask whether the rule has undergone notice and comment in order to determine whether it can be made legally binding. This proposal, which I call the "short cut," would economize on judicial decision costs. Moreover, its proponents say, it would not reduce oversight of the administrative process, because agencies would often opt to submit their rules to notice and comment ex ante in order to ensure that they are treated as legally binding ex post. Lately, proponents of the short cut such as Manning and Gersen have argued that their position is strengthened by the Supreme Court's 2001 Mead decision, which presumptively disqualifies nonlegislative rules from Chevron deference. This Article explains not only why judges have resisted the short cut, but also why they have been wise to do so. It argues that caution is warranted for three reasons: the short cut inadequately protects the interests of those persons, particularly regulatory beneficiaries, whose interests are affected by deregulatory or permissive agency pronouncements; it stands in tension with the longstanding principle that agencies may choose to announce new policy through either adjudication or rulemaking; and it ignores important differences between public scrutiny at the promulgation stage and heightened judicial scrutiny at the enforcement stage. Nor, I argue, does the Mead decision lend decisive force to the arguments in favor of the short cut, because nonlegislative rules are often accorded substantial deference in practice. These, in short, are the perils of the short cut.},

abstract = { Interest groups are a major channel through which citizens can express
 their opinions to decision-makers.' Their participation in policymaking
 may improve decision-making processes by supporting policies that are in
 line with citizen preferences and blocking policies that solely reflect the
 interests of the governing elite. At the same time, however, intense
 interest group pressures may make it difficult for policy-makers to
 implement the most efficient policies since such policies often impose
 costs on parts of the public. Competition among interest groups over the
 distribution of economic gains may also slow down the rate of economic
 growth (Olson I982). Finally, if some groups constantly win, interest
 group politics may undermine the legitimacy of electorally accountable
 decision making in a democracy.
 A normative assessment of the role of interest groups in democracies
 thus crucially depends upon how much power interest groups have, and
 how power is distributed among different groups. Moreover, an under-
 standing of the role of interest groups in the policymaking process is
 essential for explanations of policy outcomes. Finally, analysts trying to
 advise government on policies also have to be aware of the power of
 interest groups, as this factor determines the political feasibility of
 different suggestions. In short, research into variations in influence across
 groups and political systems is important for a series of reasons.

This report summarizes the Task Force's deliberations, indicating ways that federal agencies could do a better job of seeking citizen comment earlier in the rulemaking process and of reaching out to all affected groups in an evenhanded manner. The report includes not only targeted recommendations on transparency and public participation, but also strategic-management recommendations which, if adopted, should help ensure that agencies continue to improve their transparency and public participation practices over time.

abstract = {Recent research suggests that patterns of interaction among organized American interests have important implications for pluralist theory. The research presented here confirms that competition for policy attention exists among multiple interests having divided policy goals. However, the findings challenge the view that a proliferation of organizations leads to actual competition between interest groups as issues are resolved. It does so by shifting the level of analysis from the domain level to the issue level in order to provide a common substantive context for elite/pluralist interpretations. The analysis argues, using transaction theory, that organized interests cultivate specific and recognizable identities. From these identities, they come to occupy issue niches where they only infrequently ally themselves with or become adversaries of other interests. Rather than do so, most interests accommodate one another by concentrating on very narrow issues. Only a few organizations, usually the least influential, focus on encompassing or sectorwide issues or become large scale coalition players. That is, most interest groups avoid conflict situations. The data base includes interviews with 238 interest representatives, tracing their involvement on 402 prioritized issues and 180 acts and regulations that were finally passed.

Civil servants are openly flouting executive directives in their official capacity, despite strong norms to the contrary. The social practice raises both parallels and contrasts to civil disobedience by private citizens—meriting an analogous need for sustained scholarly debate about the phenomenon. This symposium article seeks to isolate civil servant disobedience conceptually and begin an exploration into its normative implications. In particular, it considers the ideal of a reciprocal hierarchy, whereby political appointees consult the expertise and experience of career staff as required by statute. This ideal may help to inform evaluations of civil servant disobedience as a form of bureaucratic process-perfection alongside other legitimating criteria. These factors, however, may also suggest that disobedience is often difficult to justify in practice.

abstract = {From green frogs and blue angels to white bunnies, modern consumers are confronted by a growing array of colorful eco-labels on everything from coffee to computers. When eco-labels are credible, they can lead to dramatic change in environmental practices broadly and quickly by leveraging the purchasing power of corporate clients (e.g., Walmart and McDonalds) to influence global supply chains. But the credibility of such labels is highly variable; and despite the existence of established practices for eco-labeling, many labels remain little more than superficial exercises in "greenwash." How can consumers separate greenwash from genuine attempts to address environmental challenges? 

Beyond Greenwash addresses this question by systematically investigating the credibility of transnational eco-labeling organizations across countries and commercial sectors. Using an innovative proxy measure for credibility that examines adherence to established best practices, Hamish van der Ven proposes a novel theory of rigor and credibility in transnational eco-labeling that upends conventional wisdom. He argues that the credibility of an eco-label does not depend on who creates or manages it-whether a government, industry association, professional standard setter, or environmental NGO. Rather, it depends on which types of businesses use the label. More specifically, eco-labeling organizations that target bigger, consumer-facing retailers tend to create credible eco-labels out of a desire to insulate their clients from critical scrutiny and gain acceptance in new markets. This theory challenges the conventional wisdom that only governments or environmental NGOs can create meaningful environmental governance and suggests that who is being governed matters as much, if not more, than who is doing the governing.},

abstract = {"Much has been written about the historic nature of the Obama campaign. The multi-year, multi-billion dollar operation elected the nation's first black president, raised and spent more money than any other election effort in history, and built the most sophisticated voter targeting technology ever before used on a national campaign. But what is missing from these accounts is an understanding of how Obama for America organized its formidable army of 2.2 million volunteers -- over eight times the number of people who volunteered for democratic candidates in 2004. Unlike previous field campaigns that drew their power from staff, consultants, and paid canvassers, the Obama campaign's capacity came from unpaid local citizens who took responsibility for organizing their own neighborhoods months--and even years--in advance of election day. In so doing, Groundbreakers argues, the campaign enlisted citizens in the often unglamorous but necessary work of practicing democracy. Hahrie Han and Elizabeth McKenna argue that the legacy of Obama for America is a transformation of the traditional models of field campaigning. Groundbreakers makes the case that the Obama ground game was revolutionary in two regards not captured in previous accounts. First, the campaign piloted and scaled an alternative model of field campaigning that built the power of a community at the same time that it organized it. Second, the Obama campaign changed the individuals who were a part of it, turning them into leaders. Groundbreakers proves that presidential campaigns are still about more than clicks, big data and money, and that one of the most important ways that a campaign develops its capacity is by investing in its human resources"-- 1.

abstract = {"Why are some civic associations better than others at getting--and keeping--people involved in activism? From MoveOn.org to the National Rifle Association, Health Care for America Now to the Sierra Club, membership-based civic associations constantly seek to engage people in civic and political action. What makes some more effective than others? Using in-person observations, surveys, and field experiments, this book compares organizations with strong records of engaging people in health and environmental politics to those with weaker records. To build power, civic associations need quality and quantity (or depth and breadth) of activism. They need lots of people to take action and also a cadre of leaders to develop and execute that activity. Yet, models for how to develop activists and leaders are not necessarily transparent. This book provides these models to help associations build the power they want and support a healthy democracy. In particular, the book examines organizing, mobilizing, and lone wolf models of engagement and shows how highly active associations blend mobilizing and organizing to transform their members' motivations and capacities for involvement. This is not a simple story about the power of offline versus online organizing. Instead, it is a story about how associations can blend both online and offline strategies to build their activist base. In this compelling book, Hahrie Han explains how civic associations can invest in their members and build the capacity they need to inspire action"-- Chapter 1 Introduction -- Chapter 2 Setting Up the Comparative Case Studies -- Chapter 3 Choosing Strategies for Building Power -- Chapter 4 Organizing -- Chapter 5 Mobilizing -- Chapter 6 Conclusion -- Appendix A: Methods.},

@article{Li2015a,
abstract = {This paper analyzes two common features of markets in which eco-label programs certify that products are “green”: gradation—single programs offering multiple certification standards (e.g., platinum, gold, silver)—and competition—multiple programs vying to certify to their respective standards. We find that, depending on whether programs are sponsored by industry, environmental groups, or a government, they have strikingly different incentives to grade or compete. Industry sponsors are indifferent about both; environmentalist sponsors optimally grade or compete with other environmentalist sponsors only if consumer preferences for green consumption are skewed in a specific way; and government sponsors׳ decisions depend on the relative importance of private vs. public benefits generated by the green market. We find also that it is no accident that green markets frequently have an environmentalist program competing with an industry one. For each of the cases examined, our analysis is consistent with casual empirical evidence.},

We argue that using a comprehensive conceptual framework is needed to assess the successes and limitations of FSC certification. We introduce a supply chain strategy framework to address three questions: (a) What are the requisite supply chain conditions for certification programs to be successful? (b) How well does the tropical timber sector meet these conditions? (c) What actions could make FSC certification efforts more effective? We conclude that some conditions necessary for a successful supply chain strategy are not found in the tropical timber industry. As a result, FSC certification faces severe limitations as a governance tool for tropical forest conservation. We suggest that a collaborative approach to creating markets for certified timber will improve FSC certificate program effectiveness.},

To probe the prospects and limits of this shift toward eco-consumerism as a mechanism for global change, this article analyzes its value for improving forest management globally. It reveals that eco-consumerism is improving some aspects; yet, for both supply and demand-side reasons, the advances are incremental and unequal and overall doing little to slow deforestation. The article therefore highlights the danger of overestimating the potential of voluntary eco-certification and advances a set of policy and management solutions to enhance the effectiveness of eco-consumer initiatives such as forest certification. Solutions include internal incremental adjustments to certification programs, coordinated alongside more fundamental external systemic changes in the marketing, industrial use, and valuation of the world's forests.},

Our study looks at a sample of 349 German energy sector firms to identify which perspective holds greater explanatory power.

Based on impression management theory, we examine how a firm's environmental practices create its environmental reputation.

We also propose that corporate environmental disclosure moderates these relationships. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 241 U.S. firms included in Newsweek's Green Rankings. Our results suggest that managers should avoid decoupling because such practices heavily jeopardize environmental reputation.

We illustrate this point through the example of carbon markets. The development of futures and other financial derivatives contributes to the compression of time, whereas the movement of capital worldwide contributes to the compression of space. This time–space compression disembodies financial instruments from their physical target, namely, carbon, leading to the distortion of the instrument's “real” value and hampering carbon emissions reductions.

abstract = {Corporate sustainability has become mainstream; reaching into all areas of business management. Yet despite this progress, large-scale social and ecological issues continue to worsen. In this article, we examine how corporate sustainability has been enacted as a concept that supports the dominant beliefs of strategic management rather than challenging them to shift business beyond the unsustainable status quo. Against this backdrop, we consider how hybrid organizations (organizations at the interface between for-profit and nonprofit sectors that address social and ecological issues) are operating at odds with beliefs embedded in strategic management and corporate sustainability literatures. We offer six propositions that define hybrid organizations based on challenges they present to the beliefs embedded in these literatures and position them as new heretics of strategic management and corporate sustainability orthodoxy. We conclude with the implications of this heretical force for theory and suggest dire...},

We review and synthesize this fragmented and multidisciplinary literature, showing that greenwash is a broad umbrella term that encompasses a variety of specific forms of misleading environmental communication.

John Ahlquist and Margaret Levi document eighty years of such activism by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union in the United States and the Waterside Workers Federation in Australia. They systematically compare the ILWU and WWF to the Teamsters and the International Longshoremen's Association, two American transport industry labor unions that actively discouraged the pursuit of political causes unrelated to their own economic interests. Drawing on a wealth of original data, Ahlquist and Levi show how activist organizations can profoundly transform the views of members about their political efficacy and the collective actions they are willing to contemplate. They find that leaders who ask for support of projects without obvious material benefits must first demonstrate their ability to deliver the goods and services members expect. These leaders must also build governance institutions that coordinate expectations about their objectives and the behavior of members. In the Interest of Others reveals how activist labor unions expand the community of fate and provoke preferences that transcend the private interests of individual members. Ahlquist and Levi then extend this logic to other membership organizations, including religious groups, political parties, and the state itself."--Provided by publisher.

Abstract = {Scholars, policy makers, and research sponsors have long sought to understand the conditions under which scientific research is used in the policy-making process. Recent research has identified a resource that can be used to trace the use of science across time and many policy domains. U.S. federal agencies are mandated by executive order to justify all economically significant regulations by regulatory impact analyses (RIAs), in which they present evidence of the scientific underpinnings and consequences of the proposed rule. To gain new insight into when and how regulators invoke science in their policy justifications, we ask: does the political attention and controversy surrounding a regulation affect the extent to which science is utilized in RIAs? We examine scientific citation activity in all 101 economically significant RIAs from 2008 to 2012 and evaluate the effects of attention—from the public, policy elites, and the media—on the degree of science use in RIAs. Our main finding is that regulators draw more heavily on scientific research when justifying rules subject to a high degree of attention from outside actors. These findings suggest that scientific research plays an important role in the justification of regulations, especially those that are highly salient to the public and other policy actors.

abstract = {presidential tweets to online grocery shopping, the Internet has revolutionized many aspects of modern life, including the way that the public engages with the federal government's rulemaking process. Not long ago, an individual wanting to submit a comment on an agency proposed rule would have to track down a paper copy of the Federal Register and mail a letter. Today, the public can comment on draft regulations in one click on www.regulations.gov, the web clearinghouse for agency rulemakings. This technological innovation means that agencies now routinely receive thousands – and sometimes even millions – of comments on draft rules. It also has given new life to lobbying in the form of public comment campaigns, or groups of identical public comments that are akin to form letters and are drafted by interest groups.[1] For instance, when the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the controversial Waters of the United States (WOTUS) proposed rule in 2014 it received more than one million public comments, of which approximately 90{\%} were identical comments organized via campaigns.

Lobbying in the form of public comment campaigns is often dismissed as “notice and spam,” suggesting that since individual commenters invest little time in drafting these comments, agencies have scant reason to take them seriously. Yet, not much is known about these campaigns—how frequent they are, which groups sponsor them, and whether they have any substantive effect on public policy.

In order to investigate the issue systematically, I collected data on the number, size, and content of public comment campaigns targeting the EPA on proposed rules issued from 2007—2014,[2] following the agency's own definition, which includes all instances in which identical comments were submitted by multiple parties.[3] This exercise indicated that public comment campaigns are routine, at least for environmental rulemaking;[4] of the 359 EPA proposed rules in my dataset, 57 (16{\%}) were subject to at least one public comment campaign.  Further, 33 of the proposed rules (9{\%}) were subject to three or more campaigns.

Because the EPA is an agency tasked with arbitrating between two often-conflicting interests, the environment and industry, I also considered how these perspectives were represented in comment campaigns. For each campaign where the sponsoring organization was identifiable,[5] I coded whether the sponsor was an industry group (e.g., a corporation, trade association, union, or profit-oriented entity), an advocacy group (i.e., an organization centered on advancing the public interest or advocating for a specific cause), or some other type of group. },

abstract = {Second edition. A comprehensive overview of the field of comparative administrative law that builds on the first edition with many new and revised chapters, additional topics and extended geographical coverage. This Research Handbook's broad, multi-method approach combines history and social science with more strictly legal analyses. This new edition demonstrates the growth and dynamism of recent efforts - spearheaded by the first edition - to stimulate comparative research in administrative law and public law more generally, reaching across different countries and scholarly disciplines. A particular focus is on administrative independence with its manifold implications for separation of powers, democratic self-government, and the boundary between law, politics, and policy. Several chapters highlight the tensions between impartial expertise and public accountability; others consider administrative litigation and the role of the courts in reviewing both individual decisions and secondary norms. The book concludes by asking how administrative law is shaping and is being shaped by the changing boundaries of the state, especially shifting boundaries between the public and the private, and the national and the supranational domains. This extensive and interdisciplinary appraisal of the field will be a vital resource for scholars and students of administrative and comparative law worldwide, and for public officials and representatives of interest groups engaged with government policy implementation and regulation.-- Introduction / Susan Rose-Ackerman, Peter L.

abstract = {Policymakers today rely primarily on statistical, financial, and other forms of technical data as their basis for decision-making. Yet, there is a potentially underestimated value in substantive reflections of the members of the public who will be affected by a particular piece of regulation. We discuss the value of narratives as input in the policy making process, based on our experience with Regulation Room-a product of an interdisciplinary initiative using innovative web technologies in real-time online experimentation. We describe professional policymakers and professional commenters as a community of practice that has limited shared repertoire with the lay members of the public trying to engage with the policymaking process, which constitutes a significant barrier to participation. Based on our work with Regulation Room, we offer an initial typology of narratives-complexity, contributory context, unintended consequences, and reframing-as a first step towards overcoming conceptual barriers to effective civic engagement in policymaking.},

@article{Wagner2010,
abstract = {There are no provisions in administrative law for regulating the flow of information entering or leaving the system, or for ensuring that regulatory participants can keep up with a rising tide of issues, details, and technicalities. Indeed, a number of doctrinal refinements, originally intended to ensure that executive branch decisions are made in the sunlight, inadvertently create incentives for participants to overwhelm the administrative system with complex information, causing many of the decisionmaking processes to remain, for all practical purposes, in the dark. As these agency decisions become increasingly obscure to all but the most well-informed insiders, administrative accountability is undermined as entire sectors of affected parties find they can no longer afford to participate in this expensive system. Pluralistic oversight, productive judicial review, and opportunities for intelligent agency decisionmaking are all put under significant strain in a system that refuses to manage-and indeed tends to encourage-excessive information. This Article first discusses how parties can capture the regulatory process using information that allows them to control or at least dominate regulatory outcomes (the information capture phenomenon). It then traces the problem back to a series of failures by Congress and the courts to require some filtering of the information flowing through the system (filter failure). Rather than filtering information, the incentives tilt in the opposite direction and encourage participants to err on the side of providing too much rather than too little information. Evidence is then offered to show how this uncontrolled and excessive information is taking a toll on the basic objectives of administrative governance. The Article closes with a series of unconventional but relatively straightforward reforms that offer some hope of bringing information capture under control.},

Agencies appear readily able to issue a sizeable number of rules and to do so relatively quickly.

@article{JosephOConnell2008,
abstract = {Despite the administrative state's extensive scope, we know little about how it operates as an empirical matter. This Article provides the first comprehensive empirical examination of agency rulemaking, with and without prior public comment, from President Ronald Reagan to President George W. Bush. Using a large new dataset constructed from twenty years' (1983-2003) worth of federal agencies' semi-annual reports in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, this Article analyzes variation in agency rulemaking activities with an emphasis on rulemaking at the beginning and end of presidential administrations and around shifts in party control of Congress -- midnight and crack-of-dawn regulatory activity -- while also assessing some patterns outside those periods.

The empirical results offer new insights into the rulemaking process and the interplay of politics and regulation. Some of these insights are surprising. For example, certain agencies withdrew more proposed rules after political transitions in Congress than after a new President took office. Rather than capitalizing quickly on their electoral mandates, Presidents generally started fewer, not more, rules in the first year of their terms than in later years. Agencies generally did complete more rules in the final quarter of each presidential administration, but cabinet departments (as a group), finished slightly more actions after the 1994 election changed control of Congress than in President Clinton's last quarter. And although the press highlighted President Clinton's spate of midnight regulatory activity, President George H.W. Bush began nearly 50 percent more notice-and-comment rulemakings in the final quarter of his term than did President Clinton and nearly 40 percent more than President Reagan.

The results have potentially far-reaching normative and doctrinal implications for the functioning and oversight of the administrative state. Politics aside, many agencies have engaged in considerable notice-and-comment rulemaking, suggesting that the traditional regulatory process may not be significantly ossified. Nevertheless, binding rulemaking without prior comment has increased across a wide range of agencies. Focusing on politics, these patterns of regulatory activity during political transitions undermine theories of judicial deference based entirely on agency expertise. But, at the same time, they do not support a political accountability theory based solely on the President. Rather, the regulatory trends call attention to the importance of Congress, in addition to the President, for bureaucratic oversight. In sum, the timing of rulemaking raises interesting questions about the effectiveness and legitimacy of the administrative state.

Given that evidence suggests comments matter at least some of the time and given that agencies seem to welcome feedback, a broad, cross-agency study of participation in rulemaking is needed. In this article, I find preliminary evidence of associations between agency expertise, congressional salience, rule significance, and legal deadlines with participation. Using an original dataset consisting of over 20,000 rules-all those available on regulations.gov between 2004 and 2016-I show that expertise requirements are strongly and negatively associated with the number of public comments those agencies receive. I also find that an agency's congressional salience has a positive association with participation. Agency-reported rule significance is positively associated with participation, and finally, rules with legal deadlines receive less participation overall. These results have important implications for agency design and bureaucratic responsiveness and offer a first step forward in understanding contextual determinants of public participation in rulemaking.},

abstract = {The study of the politics of regulation has followed two distinct paths in recent years. "New institutionalism" research has focused primarily on the policy-making process, particularly the interplay between regulators (who implement policy) and their political principals (who attempt to control regulators' activity). In contrast, "new governance" scholarship has focused on strategies other than traditional "command-and-control" regulation that can encourage compliance with socially valued norms of behavior. Although these two lines of research approach highly distinct facets of regulation and have developed largely independently of each other, they exhibit a generally unacknowledged and extensive overlap in their theoretical structure and associated results. In this article , we compare these two approaches to regulatory politics. For each, we discuss how the interactions of key actors are conceptualized, consider the types of regulatory mechanisms used to manage behavior, and examine the breadth of outcomes that flow from these controls. We suggest that greater acknowledgment of the commonalities in the two approaches can advance each approach, even if they continue to be pursued separately, and can also help generate important synthetic avenues for further research.},

Yet, assigning competing missions to one organization can be better than separating them, as the underlying tasks supporting the goals may require coordination. In fact, it is precisely when ambiguity becomes more debilitating that the importance of coordination intensifies. Moreover, if the bureau is misinformed about which goals are more valued politically, fostering uncertainty in agencies charged with multiple goals can even be beneficial.

Settlement is a common and important tool for avoiding litigation, but it also raises potential problems for administrative law. In particular, to the extent that an appellate litigation posture poses a principal/agent gap, an agency's incentives to settle may lead it to abandon its public interest goals, otherwise protected by statutory mandates as well as administrative procedures. The problem is most salient when an agency agrees to a substantive policy position in a settlement, committing the agency to later implement a policy course. To the extent an agency uses the same administrative procedure to implement a settlement that was used in adopting the regulation that is the subject of an appeal, the public interest may be preserved, but agencies have many ways of avoiding administrative procedure, or affording less procedure than was afforded in the initial adoption of a rule, in implementing settlement concessions.},

This "discretionary floor" rises as future events become more uncertain.

They may sound alarms when agencies threaten harm, but they also subsidize the interventions of sympathetic overseers postalarm. We test the theory's hypotheses with data from face-to-face surveys of lobbyists involved in an EPA rulemaking to revise air quality standards.

Nonetheless, their behavioral patterns often appear anomalous when viewed in the light of existing theories. We revisit these anomalies in search of an alternative theory. We model lobbying not as exchange (vote buying) or persuasion (informative signaling) but as a form of legislative subsidy—a matching grant of policy information, political intelligence, and legislative labor to the enterprises of strategically selected legislators. The proximate political objective of this strategy is not to change legislators' minds but to assist natural allies in achieving their own, coincident objectives. The theory is simple in form, realistic in its principal assumptions, and counterintuitive in its main implications. Empirically, the model renders otherwise anomalous regularities comprehensible and predictable.

abstract = {The identification of substantively similar policy proposals in legislation is important to scholars of public policy diffusion and legislative politics. Manual approaches are prohibitively costly in constructing datasets that accurately represent policymaking across policy domains, jurisdictions, or time. We propose the use of text-sequencing algorithms, applied to legislative text, to measure the similarity of the policy proposals advanced by two bills. We study bills from US-state legislatures. We present three ground truth tests, applied to a corpus of 500,000 bills. First, we show that bills introduced by ideologically similar sponsors are more likely to exhibit a high degree of text reuse. Second, we show that bills classified by the National Conference of State Legislatures as covering the same policies exhibit a high degree of text reuse. Third, we show that rates of text reuse between states correlate with the diffusion network ties identified in recent work on state policy diffusion.},

@article{Cuellar2005,
abstract = {This article empirically examines participation in three regulatory rulemaking proceedings, involving financial privacy, nuclear regulation, and campaign finance. It then uses that analysis to critique - and suggest alternatives to - existing mechanisms to achieve public participation in the regulatory state. Under existing law, agencies writing regulatory rules receive input only from those who decide they have sufficient resources and interest to send it - such as organized interest groups or companies facing compliance costs under the new rule. While some consider this demand driven process close to ideal, other observers instead seem to accept the current approach only because it appears to be a reasonable compromise adequate for an imperfect world where legitimate aspirations for widespread public participation meet real world constraints such as limited public attention to complicated regulatory issues. Under this compromise acceptance view, current procedures seem easier to accept in light of certain empirical suppositions, such as that regulatory problems can be resolved through the application of technical, scientific expertise; that individual members of the public tend to lack interest in participating in regulatory policymaking; and that even if they had such interest, they would add little to a process already informed by the views of organized interests. Drawing on an empirical analysis of thousands of public comments on these three regulations as well as a rich empirical literature in political behavior, I question many of these suppositions. (1) Contrary to conventional wisdom, comments from the lay public make up a substantial proportion of total comments about some regulations, showing at least some potential public demand for participation. (2) Dramatic differences exist in the sophistication of comments from interest groups versus individual members of the public, even though laypeople nearly always raise concerns that are relevant to the agency's legal mandate. (3) Sophistication affects the agency's acceptance of suggestions in public comments even when controlling for differences in the person or organization making a comment. (4) Interest groups do not always raise the range of concerns raised by comments from the lay public. (5) The larger public's interest in a particular regulation, and its sophistication to take part in discussing it, are both themselves shaped by the process of how the public is consulted. All this hints at a rich set of possibilities for alternative institutional designs to involve the public in specific regulatory decisions and enhance governance as a whole. I argue that such alternative institutional designs are feasible, and that they would provide regulators with valuable expanded knowledge about how informed members of the public react to regulatory rules. A principled defense of the current approach would therefore rest most plausibly either on an idealized conception of representative politics and interest group politics, or on a sense that no changes to regulatory democracy are politically feasible. Both of those positions need to be defended, and many such defenses are far from satisfying.},

abstract = {(“[B]urdensome though administrative procedures can be, they do not involve the same types of ‘vetogates' entailed in getting legislation through Congress and signed by the President.”). Last term, in Federal Communications Commission (FCC) v. Fox Television Stations, the Supreme Court expressly refused to link ordinary administrative law to constitutional concerns, insisting that whether an agency action is “arbitrary and capricious” and whether it is unconstitutional are separate questions. In this article, I argue that Fox is wrong. The Court's protestations aside, constitutional law and ordinary administrative law are inextricably linked, with the result that a fair amount of ordinary administrative law qualifies as what Henry Monaghan famously termed constitutional common law. Its doctrines and requirements are constitutionally informed but rarely constitutionally mandated, with Congress and agencies enjoying broad power to alter specific administrative mechanisms notwithstanding their constitutional aspect. Recognizing the interrelationship between constitutional law and ordinary administrative law is important both for the ongoing debate over the legitimacy of constitutional common law and for proper appreciation of the role administrative agencies can play in our constitutional order. Underlying many attacks on constitutional common law is a view of constitutional law as having a narrow and determinate scope, but the interwoven relationship between ordinary law and constitutional law in the administrative law context suggests this view of constitutional law is a false one. In addition, seeking to enforce constitutional norms through ordinary administrative law better accords with constitutional principles than efforts to segregate out the two and is likely to prove less intrusive to the policymaking prerogatives of the political branches. As a result, the better critique is not the extent to which constitutional common law surfaces in administrative contexts, but rather the lack of transparency that accompanies it.},

@article{Michaels2015,
abstract = {This Article sets forth the theory of an enduring, evolving separation of powers, one that checks and balances state power in whatever form that power happens to take. It shows how this constitutional commitment was first renewed and refashioned in the 1930s and 1940s, wherein the construction of a secondary regime of administrative checks and balances triangulated regulatory power among politically appointed agency leaders, an independent civil service, and a vibrant and pluralistic civil society. And it supplies the legal precedent, corrective blueprint, and normative imperative for subsequent generations (including ours) to reaffirm that commitment whenever new threats to limited, rivalrous government arise. This commitment to an enduring, evolving separation of powers helps explain our past and our present — and it readies us for the future. First, reframing the administrative state through the lens of an enduring, evolving separation of powers provides a more seamless connection to the Founding. The twentieth-century shift to administrative governance toppled the Framers' tripartite constitutional regime. But the subsequent construction of an administrative separation of powers represented an act of constitutional restoration, anchoring the modern administrative state firmly within the constitutional tradition of employing rivalrous, heterogeneous institutional counterweights to promote democratic accountability and compliance with the rule of law. Second, this reframing resolves seemingly intractable normative and jurisprudential struggles in contemporary administrative law, harmonizing today's leading (but conflicting) theories and doctrines of public administration. And, third, this reframing prepares us for life in the post-administrative state, a reality that is already beckoning. Increasingly the forces of privatization are consolidating state and commercial power in ways that compromise administrative separation of powers. Understanding privatization not as a sui generis phenomenon but instead simply as the latest, perhaps greatest, threat to an enduring, evolving separation of powers enables us to employ the grammar and doctrinal imperatives of constitutional separation of powers to insist that privatization's proponents take on the responsibility for reestablishing limited and rivalrous governance amid the dynamic turn to the market — or else abandon the enterprise altogether.},

While there have been several important critiques of the latest policy revolution linking the behavioral sciences and the state in the pursuit of human behavioral change, few scholars have investigated the potential costs of “nudging” for democratic citizenship and the deliberative capacities upon which democratic self-governance relies. A central purpose here is to consider the possible civic consequences of nudging within the pursuit of otherwise desirable social outcomes (like improved public health, energy conservation, or higher rates of financial saving). Through a critical investigation of the governing philosophy of the “nudging state” and drawing on the policy feedback literature, I argue that the recent behavioral turn in public policy risks overlooking or bypassing the personal capacities and institutional conditions necessary for the meaningful exercise of democratic citizenship. Evidence from the empirical assessment of deliberative democracy shows how liberal societies can fruitfully address bounded rationality while facilitating civic virtues like public practical reason without violating liberty or constraining pluralism.},

abstract = {Climate policy stability is often considered to be instrumental in redirecting significant financial
flows toward climate action by minimizing risk and uncertainty for investors. The logic is that
uncertain climate policies create too many risks for private sector actors seeking to engage in
low-carbon ventures. There are, however, many sources of instability that complicate the
enactment of enduring responses along with tensions between policy stability and adaptability in
the context of multidecadal processes of low-carbon innovation. And so, instead of emphasising
policy stability, we adopt a somewhat more modest goal: stabilizing the overarching orientation
of climate policy as a transition towards a low-carbon economy. That is, we are principally
concerned with the role of policy in making the low-carbon course of development durable,
signalling continuous movement in this direction. It is this goal that motivates our analysis and
raises two central research questions. First, how can the overarching direction of low-carbon
change be stabilized, avoiding the reversal or erosion of the low-carbon course of development?
Second, through which specific mechanisms might this policy orientation be instilled with
greater “stability, coherence, and integrity as time passes, achieving its basic promised goals
[i.e., decarbonization] amid the inevitable vicissitudes of politics” (Patashnik, 2003, p. 207)? In
order to address these interrelated questions, this paper surveys the diverse literature on policy
stickiness, drawing on three concepts of particular relevance for this discussion: path
dependency, policy feedback, and transition pathways. From this, we distill four prominent
mechanisms that may help stabilize the overarching climate policy orientation and entrench the
low-carbon transition: (1) increasing the political cost of reversal or erosion; (2) encouraging the
emergence and development of supportive policy constituencies; (3) embedding the low-carbon
transition within a supportive ecosystem of institutions; and (4) building societal legitimacy for
the low-carbon transition. These mechanisms are summarized below.},

abstract = {and Keywords Scholars across politics and communication have wrangled with questions aimed at better understanding issue salience and attention. For media scholars, they found that mass attention across issues was a function the news media's power to set the nation's agenda by focusing attention on a few key public issues. Policy scholars often ignored the media's role in their effort to understand how and why issues make it onto a limited political agenda. What we have is two disparate definitions describing, on the one hand, media effects on individuals' issue priorities, and on the other, how the dynamics of attention perpetuate across the political system. We are left with two notions of agenda setting developed independently of one another to describe media and political systems that are anything but independent of one another. The collective effects of the media on our formal institutions and the mass public are ripe for further, collaborative research. Communications scholars have long understood the agenda setting potential of the news media, but have neglected to extend that understanding beyond its effects on mass public. The link between public opinion and policy is "awesome" and scholarship would benefit from exploring the implications for policy, media, and public opinion. Both policy and communication studies would benefit from a broadened perspective of media influence. Political communication should consider the role of the mass media beyond just the formation of public opinion. The media as an institution is not effectively captured in a linear model of information signaling because the public agenda cannot be complete without an understanding of the policymaking agenda and the role of political elites. And policy scholars can no longer describe policy process without considering the media as a source of disproportionate allocation of attention and information. The positive and negative feedback cycles that spark or stabilize the political system are intimately connected to policy frames and signals produced by the media.},

abstract = {“When has a public comment on a federal regulation actually made a significant difference?”

This question consistently arises during workshops, presentations, volunteer trainings, and even from the editor of our article in The Conversation. As an organization whose mission is to encourage scientists and other experts to submit public comments, this question cuts to the heart of The Public Comment Project.

The “success” story that first inspired us at The Public Comment Project involves a comment made by a marine scientist on a rule designating critical habitat for the endangered black abalone. “Critical habitat,” is set aside for special management and protection because it is essential to the conservation and recovery of an endangered or threatened species. In response to this particular public comment, the National Marine Fisheries Service expanded critical habitat for the black abalone to better protect early life stages of the species. (Read more about it here!)

A more far-reaching example is the 2015 proposal to amend federal regulations on research with biospecimens. The many public comments made on the original proposal, and the resulting changes those comments inspired, were summarized by folks at The Hastings Center Bioethics Forum as “successfully” impacting the final regulations.

Public comments have also been used to strengthen regulatory decisions, such as when federal agencies used submitted information and studies to support Endangered Species Act listings of the hyacinth macaw and the Taiwanese humpback dolphin. And there are many minor examples where public comments initiated key clarifications in the language of the regulation. This includes an August 2018 rule on a renewable fuel standards program, and a July 2016 rule on the use of Medicare data.

At the Public Comment Project, we now begin our workshops by highlighting a few of these examples, which is how we kicked off our most recent workshop for the Science Rising effort.

Our workshops engage a wide variety of experts in the public comment process, allowing us to branch out from our more academic roots. Each workshop draws in a new – and equally important – dimension of the public: students, non-academic scientists, community leaders, and concerned citizens. Partnering with Science Rising was especially rewarding in this respect, as we were able to reach a new community of potential public commenters.

With such a diversity of experiences, backgrounds, and goals, there is always a new question raised or opinion given. And many of these questions, like the one above, get at the core of the public comment process.},

Few topics have received as much popular and scholarly attention as the rise of congressional
polarization and its impact on government performance. Scholars and journalists
have often blamed partisan conflict within Congress for low congressional approval
ratings (Binder 2003), understaffed courts and agencies (Binder and Maltzman 2009;
Viser 2013), and an inability to act on key issues (Weisman 2013) or simply run the dayto-day
operations of the government (Helderman 2011). Within the Senate, critics have
long blamed the filibuster for fueling obstructionist tendencies and holding up meaningful
reforms (Binder and Smith 1997; Smith 2014). In 2013, Democrats resorted to using
the nuclear option following frequent, prolonged Republican obstruction via filibuster
on the president's lower-level judicial nominees. Frustration with this obstruction was
especially apparent prior to the November 2016 election as Republicans in the Senate
refused to consider Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination. In an era of increasingly
polarized congressional parties, presidents have faced greater obstacles to filling key
vacancies in both the executive branch and in the judiciary},

abstract = {An underlying assumption of many open government enthusiasts is that more public participation will necessarily lead to better government policymaking: If we use technology to give people easier opportunities to participate in public policymaking, they will use these opportunities to participate effectively. Yet, experience thus far with technology-enabled rulemaking (e-rulemaking) has not confirmed this “if-then” causal link. Such causal assumptions1 include several strands: If we give people the opportunity to participate, they will participate. If we alert people that government is making decisions important to them, they will engage with that decisionmaking. If we make relevant information available, they will use that information meaningfully. If we build it, they will come. If they come, we will get better government policy. This Article considers how this flawed causal reasoning around technology has permeated efforts to increase public participation in rulemaking. The observations and suggestions made here flow from conceptual work and practical experience in the Regulation Room project. Regulation Room is an ongoing research effort by the Cornell eRulemaking Initiative (CeRI), a multidisciplinary group of researchers who partner with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and other federal agencies. 2 At the 1. Fallacies of this kind (sometimes referred to as “magical thinking”) refer to nonscientific causal reasoning, and can be associated with a number of cognitive biases (i.e., mistakes human beings make in reasoning, evaluating, remembering, or other cognitive processes) and include attentional bias and confirmation bias. See Behavioral Law and Economics 1-10 (Cass Sunstein ed., Cambridge University Press 2000), for an introduction to cognitive biases. 2.

However, treating the value of more participation as selfevident has left us without guidance on how to value the new participation that technology brings, and on how to deploy technology to get the participation we really want. Part II analyzes the differences between how participation is valued in electoral democracy and in rulemaking. Part III discusses implications of these differences for designing rulemaking participation systems. I.

That founding was the culmination of a year-long process of tapping the opinions of scholars and men of affairs interested – as the original circular letter put it -- in “the establishment of some representative body that can take the scientific lead in all matters of a political interest, encouraging research, aiding if possible in the collection and publication of valuable material and, in general advancing the scientific study of politics in the United States.”1   Did it make more sense – asked the circular letter -- to organize special-interest sections within the AEA, the AHA and the American Social Science Association or to launch an independent national association?  Fortunately for us, prospective members overwhelmingly chose the latter course.  In New Orleans, they adopted a constitution and elected founding officers for the American Political Science Association, including Frank J. Goodnow of Columbia University as the first president.  Much has changed over the past century.  An Association that started with founding participants numbering in the dozens now boasts about 14,000 members.  An association once closely focused on the formal arrangements of law and government now encompasses a much broader understanding of politics; and presidential addresses over the decades document the emergence of behavioralism, systems theories, and rational choice to coexist with new variants of institutional analysis.  An association that originally functioned through ten scholarly and 
 2governing committees now has 47 program divisions, 35 organized sections, 55 related groups, and 42 committees devoted to governance, awards, and representation. Each year, some 700 people, about one of every twenty members, participates in the voluntary leadership of the APSA and its sections. Last but not least, an association founded by white men now includes a rainbow of persons and is about to witness the first instance in which a woman president hands off the gavel to a female successor.       Despite the many changes over the decades, there have been important continuities – so many that Frank Goodnow and his colleagues would surely recognize us today as understandable inheritors of the association and disciplinary vision they launched in 1903.  Now, as then, organized political science encompasses normative theory as well as empirical research.  Now, as then, the APSA features comparative research, area studies, and a focus on international politics as well as studies of American politics; and our membership is international.  The APSA fosters pedagogy as well as research.  We nurture ties to neighboring disciplines and proudly include scholars who started elsewhere in our ranks.  Now, as then, we aim to link responsible citizenship in the larger society to scholarly studies of government and politics.  In the words of Pendleton Herring delivered in his APSA presidential address fifty years ago, “as we {\ldots} develop political science as a discipline we both serve our professional needs and perform the vital function of helping our democracy to know itself better.

abstract = {IN Morristown, New Jersey, five housewives, including an elderly
widow, sat in the shovel of a bulldozer for more than an hour to
protest the building of an interstate highway through a section of
town occupied by historic homes. Mrs. Cooke, the widow, sat in the
shovel sobbing softly as police demanded that the women move. "This
is such a lovely town," she said, "I do not know what will become of
it." After repeated threats of arrest, the women finally gave way and
the bulldozer began ripping into a frame house a block from a mansion
where Washington spent a winter in 1779. The State Highway
Department was unmoved by the protest. A spokesman said: "These
women just aren't looking at the big picture. Our route has been approved,
and we are going through with it."
In Mt. Vernon, New York, on the same day, it was reported that
work on widening a parkway was resumed after the failure of a demonstration
by residents. A few days before, dozens of housewives and
businessmen, angered that age-old trees were to be torn down for the
highway, had stationed themselves at dawn in front of heavy machinery
used in building the highway. Police demanded that they
leave and workmen started a bulldozer roaring toward the residents,
who linked arms and refused to budge. The police pulled the line
apart, twisting arms and legs. Men in business suits fell down, women's
handbags flew open, and fifteen persons, who had made themselves
dead weight on the ground, were finally carried away bodily. Sixteen
persons were arrested, including a rabbi, two pregnant women, and
the wife of a Westchester County Supervisor. A New York Transit
Police Captain, also a resident, was arrested for punching a policeman.

Congress instructed the President to issue rules to provide pensions for disabled veterans of the Revolutionary War in an Act of September 29, 1789. The tremendous increase in the size and scope of the federal government during the twentieth century has increased dramatically the number of rules issued by federal agencies.' The Code of Federal Regulations now occupies many feet of library shelf space, and it contains only the most important agency rules. Every major agency has a file room full of interpretative rules, characterized variously as staff manuals, design criteria, advisories, policy statements, enforcement guides, etc. As Peter Strauss has shown, the history of rules and rulemaking in the U.S. legal system is characterized by powerful ambivalence rooted in two conflicting characteristics of our political and social culture.2 We place a high value on efficiency, fairness, and accountability. Rules and rulemaking further those values? Yet, we harbor a deep distrust of government and government officials. That distrust induced the Framers to create a government that consists of three independent branches, each with enough power to serve as an effective check on the exercise of the powers conferred on the other two branches. Our distrust is particularly apparent in the procedures required to enact a statute.},

The author argues that new technologies have produced the fourth in a series of "information revolutions" in the United States, stretching back to the founding. Each of these, he argues, led to important structural changes in politics. After reinterpreting historical American political development from the perspective of evolving characteristics of information and political communication, the author evaluates effects of the Internet and related new media. The analysis shows that the use of new technologies is contributing to "postbureaucratic" political organization and fundamental changes in the structure of political interests.

@phdthesis{Potter2014dis,
abstract = {Agencies have an impressive batting average when it comes to rulemaking; by my calculation, nearly three quarters of the more than 4,000 rule proposals that agencies advanced between 2000-2010 went on to become binding law. The fact that agencies persevere is surprising given that Congress and the president frequently decry agency decisionmaking, as well as the red tape associated with regulations. Further, agency success with regard to rulemaking is not necessarily the outcome predicted by political science theories about oversight of bureaucratic agencies. For instance, in the case of the EPA, theories of congressional 3 I define “significant” rules as those that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) selected for review. This figure is on par with EPA's regulatory volume in previous congresses. 4Congress responded to the rule by temporarily stripping the FTC of its oversight over cigarette advertising, which prevented that half of the rule from taking effect. The packaging part of the rule, however, stood firm. 2 control of the bureaucracy would predict that the agency would have reduced the volume of rules produced or at least curbed the ambitiousness of their rulemaking proposals given congressional hostility (e.g., Olson, 1996; Weingast and Moran, 1983; Wood and Waterman, 1991). In this dissertation project, I seek to understand why agencies are so successful in this policymaking venue. I address two specific questions: • How does the structure of the notice-and-comment rulemaking process affect the incentives of agency bureaucrats? • Given these incentives, how do agency bureaucrats ensure that their rules become binding policy? The results of this study provide insight into the role of unelected bureaucrats in the United States. My theory emphasizes the early stages of rulemaking, because these early moments are a key agenda-setting phase for the entire process. The implication is that agencies that want their rulemaking proposals to succeed must do their homework and invest considerable resources in the early phases of the process. The argument highlights how agencies use the tools at their disposal (proposal power, outreach with stakeholders, control over timing, etc.) to shepherd their preferred policies through this important process. I argue that expert bureaucrats have preferences over the selection of policy in the rulemaking process, but must be artful in employing these tools in light of oversight scrutiny from Congress and the president. These arguments contrast with the top-down view of agency rulemaking that 3 dominates the literature and have implications for the democratic accountability of unelected bureaucrats. To support this argument, I employ a variety of research methods, including a game theoretic model, statistical methods, and interviews with bureaucrats and interest group officials. This introductory chapter proceeds in five sections. I begin by providing an overview of the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. This primer is necessary, not only because the process is esoteric, but also because the details of this process matter a great deal for the arguments that I make in this dissertation. I then explain how my argument regarding strategic proposed rules fits into the broader literatures on political oversight of the bureaucracy and agency rulemaking. Next, I explain the arguments that I make about strategic anticipation and the importance of the early stages of the process. The penultimate section discusses how this work contributes to our understanding of rulemaking as a political process and the final section lays out the plan for the dissertation, offering a roadmap to the arguments and evidence in each of the subsequent chapters.},

abstract = {The effects of any important political decision are always to some degree uncertain. This uncertainty may be ameliorated by the collection of policy-relevant information. Predictably, if such information is biased, then political decisions based on that information will be biased as well. This paper explores the converse of this statement: if the policymaker is biased, will the information provided to him or her also be biased? It is shown in this paper that, in equilibrium, information provided to a sufficiently biased policymaker will inherit the policymaker's bias. Accordingly, the provision of biased policy-relevant information is not evidence of an attempt to produce biased policy decisions. The implications of the theory are examined within the context of modern administrative policymaking within the United States Federal Government.},

abstract = {1 – The important thing is less the opportunity than the actuality. So perhaps: “Robust public
engagement is vital to the rulemaking process. It permits agencies . . . .” the problem with that is that
you have defined “public engagement” to be something the agency does, not something the public
does. Given that, “robust public engagement” is wrong, but so is what the draft now has (which says
that the opportunity for agencies to do outreach is vital, which is not right). So, what about: “Full and
effective public participation is vital to the rulemaking process. It permits agencies to obtain more
comprehensive information, enhances the legitimacy of their decisions, and enhances increases public
support for their rules.”
10 – “primarily, if not solely,” in place of “considerably”
11 – delete “rulemaking”
11-12 – “Although this generates important information” for “Although agencies receive important
information from the public during the notice-and-comment process”
13 – “public engagement” seems to be being used in a different sense here as well. Replace
“engagement” with “participation”
14 – “NPRM” for “notice of proposed rulemaking”
14-15 – Move “particularly before issuing an NPRM” to the end of the sentence
22 – I admit it took me a while to grasp the specialized meaning of “public engagement,” even though
you do define it here. Perhaps out of an abundance of caution, and for clarity, this could say something
like: “For purposes of this Recommendation, ‘public engagement' refers to activities by the agency, not
activities by the public. It includes all efforts to . . . .”
25 – delete “efforts”
26 – this sentence says “through the rulemaking process”, but at line 21 it says “before issuing NPRMs”.
One or the other should go. I'd delete “before issuing NPRMs” but I defer
32 – delete “efforts”
33 – “hold” for “garner”
35 – delete hyphen between “wide” and “range”; delete “affected”
38 – perhaps “useful” for “informed” 
40 – “pursue” for “undergo”
41 – delete “efforts”
43 – I'd say: “Each method will have both distinct benefits and distinct drawbacks.”
FN6 – “Some” for “other” [“other” doesn't work because the text doesn't identify any agency or
agencies in the first place]
50 – insert “these two mechanisms are” in between “While” and “similar”
50-52 – “to solicit information” seems unnecessary. Also, the difference between choosing “an approach
to take” (RFI) and choosing between “several alternative proposals” (ANPR) is pretty vague. Maybe:
“RFIs are generally used when an agency is determining whether to proceed at all and, if so, what
general approach to take. ANPRMs are generally used when the agency has formulated one or more
regulatory proposals, but only tentatively.”
55 – I don't know what “formal” means here, or exactly what the point of the introductory clause is.
Perhaps just delete that clause and say “RFIs and ANPRMs provide agencies {\ldots}.”
61 – In addition to FACA is the PRA potentially relevant enough to mention?
67 – As per the discussion at the October 5 committee meeting, this is a place it would be good to add a
little more about the value of these sorts of meetings. Maybe something along these lines: “When all
goes well, these more dialogic sessions can produce new ideas and creative solutions that would be
missed when stakeholders simply assert their existing positions. They also can lead to some change in
stakeholders' positions in light of a greater understanding of others' concerns.”
71 – delete “efforts”
72 – “appropriate” for “qualified”
73 – not sure what “presumably” means. “presumptively”? “ordinarily”?
73 – “separate webpage” is unclear. Separate from what?
72-74 – At line 72 it's “agencies”; at line 74 it's “an agency”; need to clean that up
74 – “contemplated” is awkward and inaccurate; only some contemplated rules are relevant. I think we
could just say “these” in place of “contemplated”},

abstract = {Attached are my comments on the draft recommendations. They focus on three points:
 The importance of proactive outreach strategies, because people/groups who do not
typically participate in RM are often not watching the typical agency information outlets
 Providing info about the RM process – and the role of public participation in it – as both
a motivator to participation (why someone should expend time and energy) and as a
guide to the kind of participation that is effective and useful
 Providing substantive information in a readable, comprehensible form that new
participants can, and will, engage with
I hope that these points will also get some attention in the text preceding the
recommendations. Wider and better participation won't come from simply adding a Notice of
Inquiry or public meeting unless the agency also (1) works hard to get new people/groups into
the real or virtual room and (2) supplies substantive info in a manner much different than
conventional rulemaking materials. Based on the CeRI experience with RegulationRoom, my
concern is that more stages of formal process are unlikely to broaden useful participation without
significant changes in how agencies publicize rulemakings and participation opportunities, as
well as in how they provide information about the relevant issues and questions.

But agencies themselves are not necessarily reliable judges of this, especially given the agencies' own selfinterested bias toward streamlining the process. To that end, it may be useful to urge the agencies to err on the side of broader participation, and to set the presumption in favor of broader participation.

@article{Croley1998,
abstract = {Several important theories of regulation, perhaps especially those developed by economists and political scientists, fail to incorporate any well developed vision of the administrative process-that is, of administrative law and practice. Instead, scholars writing on the political economy of regulation routinely generalize on a plane of abstraction far above the administrative process, typically taking regulatory outcomes to be explicable simply by reference to legislator incentives. Yet of course particularized regulatory decisions are virtually always made by administrative agencies, not legislators, in view of which fact any serious theory of regulation at least implies some theory of administration. In this Article, Professor Croley begins to bridge what he considers to be a regrettable gap between theoretical work on regulation, on the one hand, and legal-doctrinal work on the administrative process, on the other. He first demonstrates that none offour major existing theories of regulation, taken on its own terms, provides either a satisfying explanation of regulatory decision-making or a reliable means of predicting regulatory outcomes. He then analyzes the theories taking a different approach-by generating a set of administrative process expectations for each theory, and then using those expectations to test the theories against some of what is currently known about legal-process rules and participation in agency-level regulatory decisionmaking. Professor Croley argues that such evaluation not only reveals further gaps in the theories under consideration, but also begins to shed light on how theories of regulation might be reconstructed by incorporating the administrative process more explicitly and comprehensively. He furthermore argues that integrating real-world observations about the administrative process also casts doubt on strong claims about the inevitability of regulatory rent-seeking and regulatory failure. for helpful comments on earlier versions of this Article.

abstract = {Conversation is often described as the soul of democracy (Dewey 1991; Habermas 1981; Rorty 1991). This is not only because it spreads awareness about social problems, but also because it stimulates deliberation about how these problems might be solved (Eliasoph and Lichterman 1999; Katz and Lazarsfeld 1955; Perrin 2006; Polletta 2004). Yet advocacy organizations that aim to stimulate conversa-tion face considerable competition for public attention. This is particularly evident in the age of social media, when myriad public con-versations unfold each day. To date, social scientists have produced two competing theo-ries of how advocacy organizations stimulate public conversation. The first suggests advo-cacy organizations succeed by making ratio-nal arguments that appeal to people's shared interests in solving social problems (e.g., Abstract Do advocacy organizations stimulate public conversation about social problems by engaging in rational debate, or by appealing to emotions? We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These " cognitive-emotional currents " create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our Facebook application. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on public deliberation, how social contagions relate to each other, and the emerging field of computational social science.},

WRITEUP:
This article claims to find evidence for a theory that public discourse oscilates between more rational and more emotional "phases" as people become overloaded with one and find posts about the other more appealing. Their two samples include facebook posts and comments from organanizations working on autism (which they claim is controverisial) and organ donation (which they claim is not controversial). 

First they test for "independence and inverse relstionship" in the percentage of emotional words and cognative words (according to an established dictionary) used in facebook posts on a given day. They do not describe these statistical tests or how to interpret the resulting statistics. They present p-values, W values, and "CCF" valus (possibly the cross correlation function's lag (in days) where correlation is greatist?).

For example, one thing that requires explaination is how the authors deal with the fact the percent of cogantive and emotional words may be negativly correlated simply by being two percentages of the same total number of words. While both are usually below 20{\%} of the text on each given day, it seems plausalbe that when there is a high percentage of one type of words, there are simply fewer remaining words that could possibly be of the other type, regardless of any substantive relationship between the types. 

Second, they measure whether an organization's post used more cognative words and less emotional words (or vice versa) than the average percentages for the previos day. They claim this represents "whether an organization contributed to a phase shift" (or, later, just "that a phase shift occured"), but, more straight-forwardly, it can be seen as whether the organization posted something new (with respect to the types of words used). Using regression with many covariates describing the posting organization and the external environment (e.g. google searches for the issue), they find a significant relationship between posts using a different mix of words and the number of unique facebook users who comment on them. 

Because they are only testing relationships within a day and because they are only looking at posts relative to the overall average, this is poor evidence of their theory. A post that uses just one more emotional word and one less cognative word than the previous day's average is classified as a "phase shift"--this measurement is very distant from the concept of "currents" over (presumably long) periods of time. The key concept of "saturation" is also not measured. Presumably, saturation implies that there is some percentage of emotional words for some period of time that will actually be followed by a decrease across the whole system, not just one organization's post. 

Aside from the confusing relationship between theory and measurement and failure to describe the statistical tests of their first two hypotheses, the presentation of both the theory and the data gathering process was clear and offers oportuntiteis for replaication with other organizations on facebook, or possibly social media sites. 

More discription of the data would have been helpful. For example, the claim that autism was more controversial than organ donation could have been supported with evidence about the percentage of text that was about more controversial topics like vaccines. Presumably their topic model would allow them to identify such posts. As presented, they only seem to use the topic model to identify "Influential Topics"--i.e. types of posts that recieved many unique commentors--as a covariate in the regression model. 

Their model indicates a postitive correlation between visual posts and the number of commenters, but it is unclear if visual posts are also correlated with the use of emptional or cognative words (an thus the key variable of interest).

As a robustness check, they count the number of commenters who used only cognative (i.e. no empotional) or only emotional (i.e. no cognative) words. They claim this is evidence that most people switched styles, which may be true, but better evidence of this claim would be the percentage of people who sometimes used a higher percentage of cogantive words and sometimes of emotional words.

The following analysis examines an original data set of 276 rules as an initial effort to fill this void. As such, it adds to our understanding of rulemaking and of broader issues of bureaucratic responsiveness and institutional control that have long been of interest to students of government and administration. We find that agency decisions to initiate rulemaking are heavily grounded in the implementation of ongoing programs and subgovernment relationships in which economic interests tend to be predominant. Yet we also find that Congress plays a prominent role in establishing the rulemaking agenda, both in an absolute sense and in relation to the president and the courts.

abstract = {Waxing eloquent, some claim that such e-rulemaking might fundamentally
transform the participatory process. 6 For now, however, the process is defined
by a more pedestrian phenomenon: spain. In typical e-rulemakings, agencies
receive thousands of comments that are short, identical statements of support or
opposition to a proposal.'
Given this deluge, some deride the current system as "notice and spain"
rulemaking, 8 treating identical posts as wasteful annoyances. 9 By contrast, some
might see the posting of such messages as simply another way to "participate
directly in the rulemaking process"'--expression at the core of the APA's
purposes.
This Comment suggests a novel, middle course: a "two-track" e-comment
system that would distinguish substantive, unique messages on one hand and
bare expressions of preference on the other. This bifurcation, in turn, would yield
significant benefits for the notice-and-comment process.
The remainder of this Comment proceeds as follows: Part I outlines the
mechanics of how this proposal would operate. Part 11 discusses the benefits that
this system would have over both the status quo and previous reform proposals.
Part 1II then addresses possible critiques of this approach, while Part IV offers a
brief conclusion.
I. Mechanics of the Two-Track System
The two-track system would operate as follows: when viewing a proposed
rule online, would-be posters would have two options: (1) a "comment track,"
and (2) a "preference track."
The first option, the comment track, would essentially use the current
system: on this track, posters with substantive, unique messages could offer full
written statements on any proposed rule. },

@article{Mckinley2016,
abstract = {Contrary to popular opinion, the Supreme Court has not yet resolved whether lobbying is constitutionally protected. Belying this fact, courts, Congress, and scholars mistakenly assume that lobbying is protected under the Petition Clause. Because scholars have shared the mistaken assumption that the Petition Clause protects the practice of “lobbying”, no research to date has looked closely at the Petition Clause doctrine and the history of petitioning in relation to lobbying. In a recent opinion addressing petitioning in another context, the Supreme Court unearthed the long history behind the right to petition and argued for the importance of this history for future interpretation of the Petition Clause.

Following the Supreme Court's direction, this Article examines the implications of the history of petitioning for lobbying and, drawing from recent empirical research on lobbying, argues that the way Congress engages with the public through our current lobbying system actually violates the right to petition. At the Founding, and for much of this Nation's history, the right of petition protected a formal, transparent platform for individual — and, in particular, minority — voices to participate in the lawmaking process. Without regard to the number of signers or the political power of the petitioner, petitions received equal process and consideration. This platform allowed both the enfranchised and unenfranchised to gain access to lawmakers on equal footing. Women, African Americans, and Native Americans all engaged in petitioning activity, and Congress attended to each equally.

Moving beyond ahistorical, decontextualized interpretations of the Petition Clause, this Article posits that our current lobbying system — wherein access and procedure are informal, opaque, and based on political power — actually violates the right to petition, which provided access and formal procedure without respect to the political power of the petitioner. The history of petitioning teaches that affording access to the lawmaking process on the basis of an individual's political power makes as little sense as affording access to courts on such a basis.

This history suggests the need for revisiting the Petition Clause doctrine. On the one hand, it argues for a stronger petition right, especially a right to consideration and response. On the other hand, it suggests a narrowed petition right that protects only practices that correspond with the traditional practice of petitioning. Fundamentally, this Article demonstrates that a contextualized understanding of the Petition Clause, grounded in an accurate historical frame, requires comprehensive reform of our lobbying system and a formalization of the petition process in order to preserve our republican form of government.

Final version of the article now available. This article is part of a much larger project on lobbying and petitioning, however, so feedback is still quite welcome: mmckinley (at) law (dot) harvard (dot) edu.

abstract = {The responsiveness of government agencies to elected officials is a central question in democratic governance. A key source of variation in responsiveness is agency structure. Yet scholars often view agencies as falling into broad structural categories (e.g., cabinet departments or independent commissions) or fixate on some features of design (e.g., " for cause " protections). I develop new estimates of structural independence based on new data on 50 different structural features of 321 federal agencies in the federal executive establishment. Using a Bayesian latent variable model, I estimate independence on two dimensions: limits on the appointment of key agency decision makers and limits on political review of agency policy. I illustrate the value of this new measure by using it to examine how structure affects political influence and how agency independence can vary over time. I n 1933, President Roosevelt asked William E. Humphrey, a federal trade commissioner, for his resignation from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Roosevelt felt the " aims and purposes of the Administration with respect to the work of the Com-mission [could] be carried out most effectively " with Roosevelt-appointed commissioners as opposed to com-missioners whose terms carried over from the Hoover administration. 1 Humphrey declined to resign, and Pres-ident Roosevelt subsequently fired him. A lawsuit ensued, making its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. After hearing the case in 1935, the Court held that appointees at the head of agencies structured like the FTC are protected from removal by the president for political reasons. Since this decision, scholars have focused on indepen-dent regulatory commissions as a special type of agency and generally view independence in terms of whether an agency is structured like the FTC—a body with multi-ple members who serve fixed terms and are protected from removal but for cause (e.g., Breger and Edles 2000; Bressman and Thompson 2010; Lewis 2003; Verkuil 1988; Wood and Waterman 1991). Yet many other structural features insulate agencies from political influence. In fo-cusing on the three distinct legal features of independent commissions, we have limited our understanding of how agencies vary across the bureaucracy, and we have failed},

We address this issue first by defining the range of competitive contexts that might surround any debate over a policy issue. We then offer a theory that predicts how audiences, messages, and competitive environments interact to influence the magnitude of framing effects. These hypotheses are tested using experimental data gathered on the opinions of adults and college students toward two policy issues—the management of urban growth and the right of an extremist group to conduct a rally. Our results indicate that framing effects depend more heavily on the qualities of frames than on their frequency of dissemination and that competition alters but does not eliminate the influence of framing.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The root of the word certification is ''to make certain''. Yet the complex technical and normative chal-lenges certification aims to address, and its engagement of diverse and distant actors, are more about trust than certainty. The reliance on trust is perhaps most evident in ''ethical'' certification schemes due to the contested normative and affective nature of their environmental and social claims. Yet there is little research on the dynamics of local to global trust in these schemes. Social scientists have instead focused on the ''legitimacy'' of certification as an authoritative governance mechanism. This discourse has reinforced general trends towards structural formalization and rationalistic control that fail to address underlying sources of distrust. This paper draws on a case study of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in British Columbia to examine how trust and distrust in certifiers influences the legitimacy and power dynamics of ethical certification, and its ability to promote desired outcomes. It observes how a global, rationalistic system for accrediting certifiers failed to build trust among core local supporters. Instead, normative and affec-tive distrust in certifiers drove the development of prescriptive standards designed to control even the most distrusted certifiers and producers. The result has been slow growth in certified area relative to industry-backed competitor schemes and the demotivation of producers who might otherwise be willing to commit to desired outcomes. The current strategy to build global legitimacy through increasingly for-malized and rationalistic certifier accreditation systems runs counter to the development of local trust in certifiers and the creation of shared values and commitment to good forestry.},

Less well understood, however, are the appropriate methods for estimating uncertainty around these estimates, which are based on untested assumptions about the stochastic processes that generate text. In this paper we address this gap in our understanding on three fronts. First, we lay out the model assumptions of scaling models and how to generate uncertainty estimates that would be appropriate if all assumptions are correct. Second, we examine a set of real texts to see where and to what extent these assumptions fail.

We argue that, under certain conditions, attending to pretreatment dynamics leads to novel insights, including a more accurate portrait of the pliability of the mass public and the identification of potentially two groups of citizens—what we call malleability reactive and dogmatic.

abstract = {It is a brute fact of contemporary globalization?unmistakable as activists and journalists catalog scandal after scandal?that the very transformations making possible higher quality, cheaper products often lead to unacceptable conditions of work: brutal use of child labor, dangerous environments, punishingly long days, starvation wages, discrimination, suppression of expression and association. In all quarters, the question is not whether to address these conditions, but how. 

That question, however, admits no easy answers. Globalization itself has freed capital from many of its former constraints?national workplace standards, collective bargaining, and supervisory state agencies and courts?designed to humanize working conditions. A natural response, best expressed in the ILO's core labor standards, has been to attempt to build global versions of national institutions by establishing universal minimum standards of work and international inspectorates and courts to monitor and enforce them. But the machinery to compel global producers to adopt those standards does not exist and will be quite difficult to build. Alternatively, some multinational corporations and non-governmental organizations have struck out on their own, agreeing voluntarily to adopt various codes of conduct and allowing outsiders to verify compliance with these codes. In some cases these efforts have yielded impressive gains. But their piecemeal character highlights the difficulties of generalizing independent monitoring into an encompassing labor regulation regime. 

In this paper, we develop a third approach that attempts to harness some of the drivers and methods of contemporary globalization to the goal of improving international labor practices. An on-going globalization of information flows and advocacy campaigns around labor and human rights issues has successfully pressured a number of firms to significantly alter their production practices and labor conditions. Leading firms in the world economy, who have mastered the disciplines that foster excellence and innovation among their own workers and suppliers globally, are being motivated to turn these practices to social concerns. The impressive gains that have been achieved in product quality, diversity, price, and innovation in global markets, can, we assert, be extended to focus these disciplines on the improvement of labor and environmental conditions, and social performance more generally. We offer "Ratcheting Labor Standards" (RLS) as a regulatory strategy that does just this; rather than devising institutions that attempt to constrain the rapidly changing forces and processes of globalization, RLS attempts to redirect some of these energies toward the advancement of social ends.},

abstract = {This article examines how the quality of domestic regulatory institutions shapes the role of global economic networks in the cross-national diffusion of private or voluntary programs embodying environmental norms and practices. We focus on ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 14001, the most widely adopted voluntary environmental program in the world, which encourages participating firms to adopt environmental stewardship policies beyond the requirement of extant laws. We hypothesize that firms are motivated to signal environmental stewardship via ISO 14001 certification to foreign customers and investors that have embraced this voluntary program, but only when these firms operate in countries with poor regulatory governance. Using a panel of 129 countries from 1997 to 2009, we find that bilateral export and bilateral investment pressures motivate firms to join ISO 14001 only when firms are located in countries with poor regulatory governance, as reflected in corruption levels. Thus, our article highlights how voluntary programs or private law operates in the shadow of public regulation, because the quality of public regulation shapes firms' incentives to join such programs.
This article examines how global trade and investment networks encourage firms to join voluntary environmental programs, and how the effects of those networks are mediated by the quality of regulatory governance in the countries in which firms operate. We explore these issues in the context of ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 14001, the most widely adopted private or voluntary environmental program in the world. This program is sponsored by the ISO, the most prominent global standard-setting body. It encourages firms to adopt environmental stewardship practices, not only by obeying environmental laws of the jurisdiction in which they function, but also by adopting policies beyond regulatory requirements (Perez, Amichai-Hamburger, {\&} Shterental 2009).1 To receive the ISO 14001 certification, a firm must adopt and document extensive environmental management systems (EMS), requiring substantial investments in personnel and training, and then receive regular audits from accredited external or third-party auditors in order to demonstrate that their management systems meet the ISO 14001 standards.

ISO 14001 is a certification standard which is supposed to signify the environmental credentials of the certified firm. It can be viewed as a “brand name” that allows firms to signal their commitment to environmental stewardship.2 Indeed, recognizing that an international “brand” certifying environmental stewardship could allow environmentally progressive firms to differentiate themselves from environmental laggards, the ISO launched the ISO 14001 program in 1996. Although the costs for firms to become ISO 14001 certified are nontrivial, by the end of 2009 there were over 220,000 ISO-14001-certified facilities across over 150 countries (ISO 2011).

There is considerable interest among scholars in understanding the emergence and diffusion of nongovernmental, voluntary, or private authority regimes in global governance (B{\"{u}}the {\&} Mattli 2011; Cashore, Auld, {\&} Newsom 2004; Cutler, Haufler, {\&} Porter 1999, Haufler 2001; Meidinger 2006; Prakash {\&} Potoski 2006; Vogel 2005). In studying the diffusion of such systems, however, scholars tend to focus on the role of global economic and social networks while paying less attention to the role of domestic institutions.3 Our contribution is to systematically study the interactive effect of both domestic institutions and international pressures in diffusion dynamics.

In collaboration with four political parties involved in the 2001 presidential elections, clientelist and broad public policy platforms were designed and run in twenty randomly selected villages of an average of 756 registered voters. Using the survey data collected after the elections, the author estimated the effect of each type of message by comparing voting behavior in the villages exposed to clientelism or public policy messages (treatment groups) with voting behavior in the other villages (control groups). The author found that clientelist messages have positive and significant effect in all regions and for all types of candidates. The author also found that public policy messages have a positive and significant effect in the South but a negative and significant effect in the North. In addition, public policy messages seem to hurt incumbents as well as regional candidates.

abstract = {Civil society today vitally supplements the traditional legislative and judicial checks on the powerful federal executive branch. As many commentators have observed, individuals, interest groups, and media outlets actively monitor, expose, and impede federal executive misdeeds. But much of government administration now occurs in the states. State executive branches have burgeoned in size and responsibility in recent decades, and state and national leaders call for devolving even more power to the states -- often on the premise that state administration will be more engaged with or responsive to the needs of state citizens. Commentators, however, have devoted little attention to whether and how civil society constraints administration in the states. 

This Article identifies and theorizes the role of civil society oversight at the state level. It finds that state agencies frequently lack the civil society check that commentators celebrate at the federal level. State agencies are, on the whole, less transparent than their federal counterparts, less closely followed by watchdog groups, and less tracked by the shrinking state-level media. Thus, despite the common refrain that state government is "closer to the people," the realities of state administration suggest the opposite is often true. This insight complicates certain tenets of federalism theory -- those that assume a close connection between state governments and their citizens -- while strengthening theories concerned about state-level faction. As a practical matter, civil society oversight is one factor that can help explain serious regulatory failures in the states -- and more optimistically, success stories. Finally, attending to civil society oversight can highlight reforms available to those who seek a state government that is more visible to and constrained by its people.},

abstract = {How does program sponsorship influence the design of voluntary programs? Why and how do voluntary programs on climate change sponsored by the state and federal governments in the United States vary in their institutional design? Scholars emphasize the signaling role of voluntary programs to outside stakeholders, and the excludable benefits that induce firms to take on non-trivial costs of joining voluntary programs. Scholars have noted several types of benefits, particularly reputational benefits programs provide, but have not systematically studied why different programs emphasize different types of benefits. We suggest that excludable benefits are likely to take different forms depending on the institutional context in which program sponsors function. We hypothesize that federal programs are likely to emphasize less tangible reputational benefits while state programs are likely to emphasize more tangible benefits, such as access to technical knowledge and capital. Statistical analyses show the odds of a voluntary program emphasizing tangible benefits increases by several folds when the program is sponsored by the state as opposed to federal government.
1. Introduction

Public law, often termed as command and control, is the key pillar of environmental governance across the world (Revesz 2001; Stavins 2004; Borck {\&} Coglianese 2009). In recent years, new instruments have emerged to supplement the extant regulatory mode. These include information-based regulations (Toxics Release Inventory), collaborative partnerships (watershed partnerships), and market-based approaches (cap and trade mechanisms).1 Importantly, Coglianese (2008) notes a “managerial turn” in environmental policy because regulators recognize that firms play a key role in solving environmental problems and firms' internal management needs to be shaped with this objective in mind (Geiser 2001; Coglianese {\&} Nash 2006). One such managerial approach is voluntary programs which impose obligations on participants that are beyond the legal requirements (or where the law is silent) to induce them to contribute to the production of environmental public goods.2 Because such efforts are expensive, in return for their efforts, participants receive excludable benefits, both tangible and non-tangible (Prakash {\&} Potoski 2006). Excludable benefits are membership benefits, which actors sponsoring the voluntary programs dispense in order to recruit participants. These benefits are “excludable” to the extent that only participants have access to them; this thwarts free-riding by nonparticipants.

Voluntary programs have proliferated across issue areas (Coglianese {\&} Nash 2001; Vogel 2005; Hsueh {\&} Prakash 2012) and across the globe (Fiorino 1999; Morgenstern {\&} Pizer 2007; Prakash {\&} Potoski 2012). For example, voluntary programs for increasing energy efficiency and curbing toxic chemical use have been established in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, among other industrialized countries (Dietz {\&} Stern 2002; Price 2005; Morgenstern {\&} Pizer 2007; Arimura et al. 2008; Hsueh 2012). Importantly, these programs are sponsored by supra-national structures such as the European Commission, national and state governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and trade associations. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has sponsored close to 100 programs while there have been over 300 programs reported by the European Environmental Agency, and 30,000 voluntary programs in Japan (Morgenstern {\&} Pizer 2007).3

Scholars have studied how voluntary programs emerge and diffuse, and their efficacy. There is less work on how the characteristics of the sponsoring actors and their institutional environment influence program design, specifically the forms in which programs supply program benefits to their participants. Indeed, much of the literature treats program design as exogenous. Because program sponsors have different attributes and function in different institutional environments, we expect voluntary programs to vary in their design, which has important consequences for public policy.

To test the link between sponsorship and design, we examine voluntary programs in the context of climate change mitigation, sponsored by US regulators who are otherwise charged with enforcing command and control regulation. To control for the national context, we focus on the United States. The US federal system offers an interesting context to unpack the category of “regulators” into federal and state regulators. This allows us to understand their varying strengths and constraints regarding program sponsorship. We believe the insights developed in this paper regarding the link between sponsorship and design should inform the discussions on voluntary programs in other “federal” systems including the European Union, its member countries, and their regions.4},

abstract = { Lane's analysis was one of the first to engage with the idea of interest groups and their representation in the bureaucracy. Lane points to the creation of client-centric agencies like the Veterans administration as proof a long tradition of interest group engagement with administrative groups (106). He differentiates between those agencies with an explicit client mandate, where representation is part of their mission, and those with long standing relationships to at times competing interests. Lane makes the claim that interest-group/agency interaction is disruptive to effective administration, and proposes stronger parties and greater disclosure requirements of lobbying efforts as possible solutions (110). 

should no longer be necessary to defend the proposition that men's diverse interests define their political existence. While appeals for a com-mon rededication to the convenient am-biguities of {\&}dquo;the national welfare{\&}dquo; are among the conventions of American campaign oratory, they fly in the face of much that we know (or should know) about ourselves. We are awed, even flattered, by descriptions of gov-ernment was a distant monolith, greater somehow than the sum of the social parts from which it derives and exigent of the good citizen's total allegiance. But we actually pattern our collective life on the somewhat different principle that government is merely a specialized instrument for the protection or frus-tration of the various ends that groups of men happen to regard as important. Once grant that men have the right to differ on fundamentals, that they have the right to want more for themselves than for others, that they further have the right to seek by any honest means to impose their wishes on their fellows, and it could not have been otherwise. Since these concessions lay close to the heart of our national life, there should be nothing startling in the fact that, from colonial times on, men and groups of men have sought both to prompt and to prevent the exercise of governmental power. This involves what Willard Hurst has called {\&}dquo;if not the fundamental object of government ... at least an aspect of government's main purpose,{\&}dquo; which is simply {\&}dquo;that men should come to it, all the more so because what they want may be against the general welfare.{\&}dquo; 1 We need not here examine {\&}dquo;the general welfare{\&}dquo; as an objective reality. It is enough to say that it may at least reflect an op-erational consensus, and that one meas-ure of a democratic order is the extent to which it protects men's right to as-sail it. GROUPS IN POLITICS A politics based on men's interests, organized to a greater or lesser degree, is not peculiar to the United States, or to constitutional republics, or, for that matter, to systems conforming to broadly democratic values. Even to-talitarian states, theoretically enlisted in total service to parahuman ends, ex-hibit in practice a distinct, if fetal, spe-cies of interest politics. Our experi-ence, rather, is distinguished by the un-usual degree to which our interests have been organized and by the special con-ditions under which they have been po-litically effective.},

abstract = {Interpersonal communication presents a methodological challenge and a research opportunity for researchers involved in field experiments. The challenge is that communication among subjects blurs the line between treatment and control conditions. When treatment effects are transmitted from subject to subject, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is violated, and comparison of treatment and control outcomes may provide a biased assessment of the treatment's causal influence. Social scientists are increasingly interested in the substantive phenomena that lead to SUTVA violations, such as communication in advance of an election. Experimental designs that gauge SUTVA violations provide useful insights into the extent and influence of interpersonal communication. This article illustrates the value of one such design, a multilevel experiment in which treatments are randomly assigned to individuals and varying proportions of their neighbors. After describing the theoretical and statistical underpinnings of this design, we apply it to a large‐scale voter‐mobilization experiment conducted in Chicago during a special election in 2009 using social‐pressure mailings that highlight individual electoral participation. We find some evidence of within‐household spillovers but no evidence of spillovers across households. We conclude by discussing how multilevel designs might be employed in other substantive domains, such as the study of deterrence and policy diffusion.

We investigate whether ecolabel sponsorship is a signal that can help consumers distinguish between ecolabels according to the quality of their institutional design. Using data of 189 prominent ecolabels, we find that while most ecolabels have basic rules for environmental performance, monitoring, and conformance, the strength of these rules varies across labels according to sponsoring organization. Independent sponsors have the strongest ecolabel rules, followed by governments. Industry sponsored ecolabels have the weakest rule structures. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest that sponsorship may provide important information about whether an ecolabel is designed with rules that effectively condition firms to promote meaningful environmental improvements.

abstract = {For more than two decades political scientists have discussed rising elite polarization in the United States, but the study of mass po- larization did not receive comparable attention until fairly recently. This article surveys the literature on mass polarization. It begins with a discussion of the concept of polarization, then moves to a critical consideration of different kinds of evidence that have been used to study polarization, concluding that much of the evidence presents problems of inference that render conclusions problem- atic. The most direct evidence—citizens' positions on public policy issues—shows little or no indication of increased mass polarization over the past two to three decades. Party sorting—an increased cor- relation between policy viewsandpartisan identification—clearly has occurred, although the extent has sometimes been exaggerated. Ge- ographic polarization—the hypothesized tendency of like-minded people to cluster together—remains an open question.To date, there is no conclusive evidence that elite polarization has stimulated voters to polarize, on the one hand, or withdraw from politics, on the other},

abstract = {State legislatures introduce at least 45,000 bills each year. However, we lack a clear understanding of who is actually writing those bills. As legislators often lack the time and staff to draft each bill, they frequently copy text written by other states or interest groups. However, existing approaches to detect text reuse are slow, biased, and incomplete. Journalists or researchers who want to know where a particular bill originated must perform a largely manual search. Watchdog organizations even hire armies of volunteers to monitor legislation for matches. Given the time-consuming nature of the analysis, journalists and researchers tend to limit their analysis to a subset of topics (e.g. abortion or gun control) or a few interest groups. This paper presents the Legislative Influence Detector (LID). LID uses the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm to detect sequences of text that occur in model legislation and state bills. As it is computationally too expensive to run this algorithm on a large corpus of data, we use a search engine built using Elasticsearch to limit the number of comparisons. We show how LID has found 45,405 instances of bill-to-bill text reuse and 14,137 instances of model-legislation-to-bill text reuse. LID reduces the time it takes to manually find text reuse from days to seconds.},

Drawing on works by historians, it traces the development of the colonial assemblies as legislative institutions. The transition of assemblies to state legislatures is investigated, as is the underappreciated impact of the first state legislatures on the rules and structures given to the U.S. Congress in the Constitution. The effects of legislative generations are revealed by the state legislatures established during the nineteenth century, as newer legislatures were equipped from their start with the rules and committee systems evolved only over time by earlier legislatures. The continuing evolution of state legislatures after the nineteenth century is linked to the concept of legislative professionalization. Finally, the relationship between legislative evolution and membership turnover is examined, as is the idea that legislatures move in both directions on the evolutionary dimension.},

abstract = {Voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) are institutions for inducing firms to produce environmental goods beyond legal requirements. A comparative perspective on VEPs shows how incentives to sponsor and participate in VEPs vary across countries in ways that reveal their potential and limitations. Our brief survey examines conditions under which VEPs emerge, attract participants, and improve participants' environmental performance. We focus on the costs and bene-fits for actors seeking to supply (or sponsor) these governance mechanisms as well as the costs and benefits for firms who are considering joining VEPs and adhering to their program obligations. {\textcopyright}2011 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. INTRODUCTION Voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) have emerged as important instruments of environmental policy and governance across the world. Their central purpose is to induce program participants, typically firms, to produce positive environmental externalities, as public goods, beyond the requirements of applicable government law.11 In return, program participants acquire the ability to more credibly signal their environmental stewardship to external stakeholders who cannot otherwise fully observe participants' environmental processes or performance. Given such information asymmetries, VEPs' branding signal allows external stakeholders to discriminate among firms based on their environmental activities. The public policy payoff of successful VEPs is that they correct a failure in the market for environmental virtue (Vogel, 2005) by enhancing stakeholders' opportunity to reward firms for environmental stewardship. While this paper focuses on VEPs, we recognize the growing prominence of voluntary approaches in other issue areas. Because voluntary programs are most developed in the environmental field, they serve as a blueprint for similar initiatives in other fields. Morgenstern and Pizer (2007) report that about 300 VEPs have been negotiated between firms and national governments in Europe and more than 87 VEPs have been sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A study of VEPs therefore informs not only understanding of environmental governance but the wider phenomena of social regulation (Rees, 1997), reflexive law (Orts, 1995), new public management (Kettl, 2002), and regulating from the inside (Cogalianese {\&} Nash, 2001). This paper outlines a comparative perspective on VEPs that helps illustrate their potential and limitations. We explore how stakeholders' demand for environmental stewardship and the policy environment in which firms function influence how sponsors create VEPs and firms participate in them. We briefly survey research along three analytical themes: (1) program emergence, under what conditions VEPs are created; (2) program diffusion, what factors encourage firms to join VEPs; and (3) program efficacy, under what conditions VEPs improve participants' environmental performance. Cross-country comparisons reveal what shapes the costs and benefits for actors seeking to supply (or sponsor) VEPs as well as the costs and benefits for firms considering joining them and adhering to their obligations. Some VEPs have been rightly criticized for the lenient standards they impose on their participants and for being an industry foil for preempting governmental regulations. While we view effective VEPs as “regulation plus,” we recognize that some VEPs have failed to promote environmental stewardship. The key lesson is that every policy approach, including VEPs, needs to be evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses, and these strengths and weaknesses ought to be assessed in the institutional and regulatory contexts in which firms operate. Policy approaches that show promise in some contexts might fail in others. Thus, it is important to explore the extent to which the ineffectiveness of some VEPs might be explained by their weak program design as opposed to their poor fit with the institutional context in which participating firms function. The paper proceeds as follows. The first section outlines our theoretical perspective on VEPs. The second section focuses on program emergence, the third section on program diffusion, and the fourth section on program efficacy. The concluding section draws broader implications from our survey and identifies avenues for future research.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}While emotions are widely regarded as integral to the “behavioral approach” to International Relations (IR), a host of fundamental problems have delayed the integration of affective influences into traditional models of IR. We aim to integrate affect by focusing on commitment problems, a body of work that contains strong theoretical predictions about how individual decision makers will and should act. Across two lab experiments, we use a novel experimental protocol that includes a psychophysiological measure of emotional arousal (skin conductance reactivity) to study how individuals react to changes in bargaining power. While we find support for one key pillar of IR theory—individuals do reject offers when they expect the opponent's power to increase—we also find that physiological arousal tampers with individuals' ability to think strategically in the manner predicted by canonical models. Our follow-up experiment mimics the elements of institutional solutions to commitment problems and finds support for their efficacy on the individual level. Our novel findings suggest that when individuals face large power shifts, emotional arousal short-circuits their ability to “think forward and induct backwards,” suggesting that emotionally aroused individuals are less prone to commitment problems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

American parties' scholars have nevertheless traditionally viewed stronger and more ideologically distinct national parties as essential to improve the quality of the American democratic process, a view reflected in the 1950 APSA report, Toward a More Responsible Party System. In the following decades the American parties appeared to weaken still further in all aspects, but this apparent party decline in fact signified a transition to a contemporary American party system with more polarized parties similar to those envisaged by the 1950 report. It remains doubtful, however, that American democracy has been enhanced by these developments. Ironically, the advent of more ideologically coherent parties has also made party scholars more aware of the potentially unhealthy side effects that may attend such a development in a separated governing system.},

Using a novel, two-part conjoint experiment, I show that respondents put high importance on the political leanings of potential Court candidates, a finding in contrast with the scholarly view that the public views the Court as different from other, more political institutions. Indeed, when respondents are given information about a nominee's partisan leanings, they rely extensively on that information in deciding whether to support the candidate, whether they trust the candidate, and whether they find the candidate qualified. By contrast, when partisan information is withheld, respondents appear to use other kinds of signals, such as race, to fill in the gaps. Those who are most knowledgeable about the Court are most influenced by these partisan signals, providing further support for the importance of political heuristics.

Since 1945, the study of Congress has gone through an anglophile responsible-party phase, championed especially byWilliamYandell Elliott at Harvard, followed by a sociologically oriented legislative-behavior phase, identified in one generation with Lewis Anthony Dexter, Stephen K. Bailey, David Truman, and especially Ralph K. Huitt atWisconsin, and in the next generation with Richard Fenno, Charles O. Jones, Donald R. Matthews, and H. Douglas Price, among others. A third, contemporary intellectual orientation is identified most strongly with rational choice scholars, especially from the University of Rochester. The agenda of political science is formed not only by the literature but by events. Hence, the congressional reforms of the 1970s were influential in shaping the literature, as were such organizational innovations as the Congressional Fellowship Program and the Study of Congress, both projects of the American Political Science Association.

o Numerous individual studies of work groups within Congress, notably com- mittees (Peabody 1963, Robinson 1963, Manley 1970, Fenno 1966) and state delegations [Truman 1959, Fiellen 1962, Deckard (Sinclair) 1972], and in studies of the politics of internal management, especially narratives describing party leadership struggles and the strategic principles that domi- nated these significant events (especially “inside” versus “outside” strategies) (Polsby 1963, Peabody 1976). 
o information could be considered in the aggre- gate or by tracking the performance of individuals, and could be used not only to monitor policy outcomes but also to follow the decision making (or cue-taking) of individual members (see Kingdon 1973, Matthews {\&} Stimson 1975). 
o Mayhew 1966), a highly creative roll-call study. Mayhew demonstrated that Democrats and Republicans behave differently toward the interest groups that make up their core constituencies. Democrats, he found, always vote to sustain their constituent interests; Republicans tend to vote on principled grounds even against their constituents and allies. 
o Congress: The Electoral Connection (1974),17 Mayhew executed one of the first—and still one of the best—rational choice studies of Congress, par- simoniously asking how members would logically behave if they were obsessed only with the goal of assuring their reelection. He deduces that in such circum- stances, members would do a lot of what we observe them doing: position-taking, credit-claiming, and advertising. The assumption of pure reelection-mindedness yields less-good predictions 
o Three themes have emerged as particularly sig- nificant in the ensuing decades. First, scholars have devoted considerable energy to understanding the major reforms adopted by Congress in the 1970s. Both the reform era itself and the contours of the so-called “post-reform” Congress have been major topics of debate. Second, the rise of rational choice approaches in the discipline at large has sparked a new focus on the design and effects of legis- lative institutions. Scholars ask to what extent congressional organization serves the interests of three sorts of aggregated actors: cross-party distributive coalitions, the majority party, and floor majorities. A major animating issue has been whether the majority party is able to use its agenda control to pull policy outcomes toward the party median and away from the median of the whole House.

Although this “deck-stacking” argument has been both influential and controversial, few scholars have subjected it to empirical examination. This article assesses the operation of a prominent administrative procedure—the notice and comment process—in the context of Medicare physician payment reform, a fundamental restructuring of the way in which the Medicare program pays for physician services. I find, contrary to the deck-stacking thesis, that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was more responsive to physicians expecting reductions in fees than to the intended beneficiaries of the new payment system. Although these results do not necessarily imply that Congress exerted little influence over HCFA decision making, they suggest that certain administrative procedures do not operate as instruments of political control.},

abstract = {Understanding public policy requires taking into account the complex relations among policy actors, institutions, and processes, all of which are in turn influenced by a variety of factors, including culture, history, and global relations. Each country's policy choices and outcomes reflect its own internal dynamics as well as influences from an increasingly globalized world. In the face of such complexity, a cross-national comparative perspective can offer analytical leverage to shed light on which policies countries adopt, the ones that work, those that do not, and why. To advance the study of comparative policy analysis, this forum presents four articles that survey important policy domains. These surveys provide a comparative summary of labor market, urban, environmental, and long-term care policy. The topics cover a mix of traditional (urban and labor market) and emerging areas (long-term care and voluntary environmental programs) of policy analysis. The articles also provide a forward-looking perspective, identifying analytical themes and empirical puzzles for future research. We posed four key questions for the authors: 1.What key debates and questions drive the research in this policy domain? 2.How and why do policy approaches, instruments, and institutions vary across countries? 3.How do policy consequences (outputs and outcomes) relate to variations in approaches, instruments, and institutions? What works, what does not, and why? 4.What unanswered puzzles and unresolved debates remain in this domain? What key issues, both theoretical and empirical, should scholars of comparative policy analysis focus on? Participants in this forum include Edward Glaeser, the Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of Economics at Harvard University; Nadine Farag, Harvard School of Public Health; Lawrence M. Kahn, the Braunstein Family Professor and Professor of Economics and Labor Relations at Cornell University; Naoko Miake, University of Tokyo and the World Bank; Aseem Prakash, the Walker Family Professor for the College of Arts and Sciences and Professor of Political Science at the University of Washington, Seattle; Matthew Potoski, Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, University of California, Santa Barbara; and Katherine Swartz, Professor of Health Policy and Economics at Harvard University. We hope this forum stimulates new multidisciplinary approaches to studying policy successes and failures, and motivates scholars to look beyond studies within a single country. Cross-national approaches can illuminate the scholarly understanding of policy analysis and hopefully lead to better public policy.},

The incumbent label maximizes its own profit, and is challenged by an industry standard which maximizes industry profit. Using a nested logit, the result of this multi-stage game depends crucially on the degree of horizontal differentiation. Joint firm profit always increases with the introduction of the industry standard. The industry standard wants to segment the market and strategically distorts its label quality downwards, such that each firm specializes in a different label. Social welfare however increases with the number of labeled products. A policy imposing a minimum label quality is only binding in the case of strategic quality distortion by the industry standard.

While previous research has identified the importance of transnational supply chain pressure and of NGOs' direct targeting campaigns in diffusing and upgrading standards, this paper stresses the role of public comparison and environmental benchmarking that contributed to an upgrading of industry standards via competition between the Forest Stewardship Council and rival industry-sponsored schemes. The paper explores how transnational and national actors created important moments of public comparison in which substantive as well as accountability standards were ratcheted up while they diffused more broadly across industry. This project evaluates the role of environmental benchmarking in constructing and contesting the legitimacy of private regulation.

He asserts that while scholars are largely in agreement that this centralization is taking place, they are largely divided over whether this is a desirable development. He finds that this exertion of presidential power was limited to a relatively small number of very important rules. Additi onally, contrary to popular belief, he doesn't find that particular interest groups have greater opportunity to offer input on rulemaking, but does find that not all groups take equal advantage of this opportunity. He does acknowledge that this defense mig ht not be tenable for all administrations; the positive assessment is predicated on open and transparent administrative law processes, without which it would be difficult to state confidently that more illicit regulatory action isn't at work (884). 

Among the many important developments in administrative law over the past two decades-indeed among developments in domestic policymaking generally-efforts by recent presidents to exert greater control over regulatory agencies rank near the very top. As many have observed,' recent presidential administrations, beginning most significantly with the administration of President Ronald Reagan, have sought to exercise increased influence over agency decisionmak-ing in both procedural and substantive ways. Procedurally, presidents have required agencies to inform the White House of important pend-ing regulatory actions and, far beyond that, to seek some form of White House approval for those actions. Substantively, recent presi-dents have required agencies to demonstrate to the White House, in the course of getting approval for their pending regulatory decisions, that major regulatory actions are justified by one form or another of cost-benefit analysis, and that those actions otherwise conform to the president's own regulatory priorities. While this trend toward greater executive control over agencies was originally closely associated with the deregulatory agenda of the President Reagan and President},

Through a comparative case study of private regulation of sustainability standards in the forestry, clothing, IT-electronics, and chemicals industries, we show how a combination of low industrial concentration, civil society involvement in governance, and stringent standards of a first-moving regulator offer the strongest explanation for a fragmented private regulatory field, while high industrial concentration, business-driven governance, and lenient standards of a first-moving regulator lead to cohesive regulation.

Practitioners typically assume that the latent space is semantically meaningful. It is used to check models, summarize the corpus, and guide explo-ration of its contents. However, whether the latent space is interpretable is in need of quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we present new quantitative methods for measuring semantic meaning in inferred topics. We back these measures with large-scale user studies, showing that they capture aspects of the model that are undetected by previous measures of model quality based on held-out likelihood. Surprisingly, topic models which perform better on held-out likelihood may infer less semantically meaningful topics.},

We contend that the balance of the evidence favors the position that senators have generally supported the maintenance of the filibuster and have been able to make procedural adjustments when obstruction threatened a committed majority's top priorities, although we offer some important refinements required in comparing the historical operation of obstruction to its impact in today's Senate.},

abstract = {Forest certification involves the labeling of certain forest practices as responsible or sustainable based on a set of environmental, economic and social standards for “good forestry”. As such, it treads within a normative arena previously reserved for government, i.e. the establishment and enforcement of acceptable rules of forest practice. Unlike governments, however, no single certification system can lay claim to ultimate authority. Instead, competing certification systems have developed. On one side is the Forest Stewardship Council, which is strongly backed by major international environmental groups. On the other, are industry-backed systems such as the Canadian Standards Association and the US-based Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Even within a single certification system, such as the FSC, differences have emerged between regional- level standards, highlighting complex and often controversial environmental, economic and/or social dynamics. The act of comparing certification standards, therefore, can be seen as a politically reflexive act serving to highlight similarities or differences in such a way as to enhance the legitimacy of any given certification standard. In fact, comparisons to date range from those finding little significant difference between certification standards to those declaring that only FSC standards, or perhaps only a particular FSC regional standard, approaches a credible measure of good forestry. This article presents a new and complementary methodology involving the systematic and analytical comparison of 1) the policy approach of different forest certification standards and 2) the difference between certification standards and underlying government regulations. The findings reveal clear differences between FSC regional standards in the US and Canada, as well as between the FSC, CSA and SFI certification systems, in regards to one key policy indicator: i.e. protection of riparian zones. The FSC British Columbian standards include the largest buffer zone requirements but are less prescriptive than those of the FSC Pacific Coast. The FSC Southeast standards are comparable to the SFI standards, while the CSA standards are the least restrictive. Comparison with government requirements shows a striking isomorphism between FSC regional standards and government requirements, whereby the certification standards in each region mimic the policy approach of government regulations in that region while providing incrementally more demanding substantive requirements. The SFI national standards reflect a mild increase in policy restrictiveness over government standards in the US Southeast and no significant change elsewhere. Finally, the CSA standards provide no substantive requirements in addition to government standards. The authors in no way claim that the methodology presented here is the only “legitimate” method for comparing standards. Nevertheless, it does represent a relatively systematic, replicable and transparent methodology for identifying similarities and differences between certification standards that are of considerable importance to a wide variety of forest stakeholders.},

To date, however, researchers have lacked guidance on how many attributes they can include within conjoint profiles before survey satisficing leads to unacceptable declines in response quality. This paper addresses that question using pre-registered, two-stage experiments examining choices among hypothetical candidates for U.S. Senate or hotel rooms. In each experiment, we use the first stage to identify attributes which are perceived to be uncorrelated with the attribute of interest — and so cannot be masked by those core attributes. In the second stage, we randomly assign respondents to conjoint designs with varying numbers of those filler attributes. We report the results of these experiments implemented via Amazon's Mechanical Turk or Survey Sampling International. They demonstrate that our core quantities of interest are generally stable, with relatively modest increases in survey satisficing when respondents face large numbers of attributes.

For all the attention accorded the issue, climate change/global warming has spawned surprisingly little grassroots activism in the contemporary United States.

The prevail-ing consensus among movement scholars is that the prospect for movement emergence is facilitated by the confluence of three factors: the expansion of political opportunities, the availability of mobilizing structures, and cogni-tive and affective mobilization through framing processes. The author then applies each of these factors to the case of climate change, arguing that (a) awareness of the issue developed during an especially inopportune pe-riod in American politics, (b) the organizations that arose to address the issue were ill suited to the kind of grassroots mobilization characteristic of suc-cessful movements, and (c) the amorphous nature of the issue played havoc with efforts at strategic framing.},

Natural Resources Defense Council (1984) signaled a lasting difference in how the justices decide administrative law cases by comparing and testing the predictions of three distinct theories of Supreme Court behavior. The legal model predicts an increase in deference to administrative agencies. This prediction is shared by the jurisprudential regime model, which also predicts that the justices evaluate key case factors differently before and after Chevron. The attitudinal model predicts no change in the justices' behavior as a result of Chevron. We find support for the all three models, although the fact that the legal and jurisprudential regime models are supported undermines the assertion of the attitudinal model that law cannot explain Supreme Court votes on the merits.},

why judges take case
Justices grant review when they believe that the policy outcome of the merits decision will be better ideologically for them than is the status quo.
- merits
- legal conflict 
- district court rules unconstitutional
- legal importance 




I have not read the Collins (2008) study, cited in Black and Owens (2009), that found that amicus briefs were poor proxies for political salience. This may be true, but this measure may also be correlated with distance between the likely outcome and the status quo (as benefits rise, more groups will be willing to bear participation costs).

Caldeira and Wright (1988) showed that when more groups file amicus curiae briefs either supporting or opposing review, the Court perceives the case to be more important.
other factors

- work load

We measure u, the predicted policy location of the Court's merits decision, as the JCS score of the median justice of the Court for the term in question


Black and Owens have several clever ways of measuring their variables which lend themselves to slightly different interpretations, including in the 2012 PRQ piece.
What Black and Owens really measure is whether justices grant cert when the JSC scores of the referring court (“status quo”) are closer to them than JCS of the median justice (“merits outcome”). 
That judges prefer cases when the status quo is more distant than the outcome of the case is the same as saying “justices are less likely to review decisions made by ideological allies than those by ideological foes” (Black and Owens 2012)
Status quo seems like a sensible interpretation of the referring court's JSC, but “ideological allies” is more intuitive. Predicted “merits outcome” imperfectly resonates with the concept of merits. Perhaps “pure policy outcome” would be better. Deciding on the merits evokes case-specific considerations that do exclude legal considerations around granting cert, but seem to be more than just policy considerations. For example, it seems that granting cert so that the court can exclude a class from standing would would here be considered ‘merits,' but Rowland and Todd would consider this procedural gatekeeping. 
Do the Black and Owens (2009) findings hold up if controlling for ideological composition of the referring court? If not, this might suggest there is more of a social factors more than a legal+strategic factors are driving the results. Black and Owens (2012) interpret their findings “conservative justices might be less likely to audit liberal lower court decisions adopted by conservative judges“ as evidence of justices receiving a signal of the “right” legal outcome. A cynic could similarly read this as signaling ‘unfriendly facts.' However, this could also be evidence of social drivers—who wants to overrule their friends? It makes for awkward cocktail parties. Could this model be improved by adding a measure of social distance as well as ideological distance—perhaps citations or common organizational affiliations.},

abstract = {Does information irrelevant to government performance affect voting behavior? If so, how does this help us understand the mechanisms underlying voters' retrospective assessments of candidates' performance in office? To precisely test for the effects of irrelevant information, we explore the electoral impact of local college football games just before an election, irrelevant events that government has nothing to do with and for which no government response would be expected. We find that a win in the 10 d before Election Day causes the incumbent to receive an additional 1.61 percentage points of the vote in Senate, gubernatorial, and presidential elections, with the effect being larger for teams with stronger fan support. In addition to conducting placebo tests based on postelection games, we demonstrate these effects by using the betting market's estimate of a team's probability of winning the game before it occurs to isolate the surprise component of game outcomes. We corroborate these aggregate-level results with a survey that we conducted during the 2009 NCAA men's college basketball tournament, where we find that surprising wins and losses affect presidential approval. An experiment embedded within the survey also indicates that personal well-being may influence voting decisions on a subconscious level. We find that making people more aware of the reasons for their current state of mind reduces the effect that irrelevant events have on their opinions. These findings underscore the subtle power of irrelevant events in shaping important real-world decisions and suggest ways in which decision making can be improved.},

abstract = {Given the extensive interconnections between state and federal actors and laws in the administrative sphere, it should be no surprise that administrative law cases — cases often involving the application of Chevron — frequently raise federalism questions. This Essay, part of the Fordham Law Review's Symposium Chevron at 30: Looking Back and Looking Forward, considers what courts should do when the worlds of Chevron and federalism collide. The Supreme Court has at times indicated that Chevron does not apply in its usual way in certain federalism cases, and a number of scholars have proposed similar approaches in particular contexts. Because these proposals all require analysis before the Chevron framework is deployed, I refer to them collectively as a “Federalism Step Zero.” 

This Essay identifies Federalism Step Zero as a distinct concept, analyzes its underpinnings and mechanics, and ultimately, argues against its adoption. The analysis focuses on the mismatch between the nature of Step Zero and the nature of federalism analysis in the administrative context. Step Zero is best served by a rule rather than a standard, a lesson evident in the aftermath of United States v. Mead Corp. and apparently part of the doctrine after City of Arlington v. FCC. But the heterogeneity of questions and goals at stake in administrative federalism cases makes bright lines a poor fit. No rule can identify accurately when agencies should answer federalism questions—and because agencies are well-positioned to resolve many such questions, there is no reason to believe that categorically denying deference would better serve federalism goals. Moreover, courts can already police bad agency interpretations through Chevron analysis and arbitrary and capricious review. A Federalism Step Zero would thus needlessly harm the coherence and predictability of the Chevron framework.

Although the focus here is on the Symposium's honoree, the Chevron doctrine, this Essay also suggests a deeper, generalizable point about administrative federalism. Federalism inquiries and values tend to be multifaceted and nuanced in ways that make them poor fits for the more formalistic, rule-bound features of administrative law. Attention to federalism requires the use of standards, in Chevron analysis and beyond it.},

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT Theory-testing occupies a central place within social science, but what kinds of evidence count toward a meaningful test of a causal proposition? We offer two analytic results that have important implications for the relative merits of observational and experimental inquiry. The first result addresses the optimal weight that should be assigned to unbiased experimental research and potentially biased observational research. We find that unless researchers have prior information about the biases associated with observational research, observational findings are accorded zero weight regardless of sample size, and researchers learn about causality exclusively through experimental results. The second result describes the optimal allocation of future resources to observational and experimental research, given different marginal costs for each type of data collection and a budget constraint. Under certain conditions (e.g., severe budget constraints and prohibitive costs of experimental data), it is optimal to allocate one's entire budget to observational data. However, so long as one harbors some uncertainty about the biases of observational research, even an infinite supply of observational data cannot provide exact estimates of causal parameters. In the absence of theoretical or methodological breakthroughs, the only possibility for further learning comes from experiments, particularly experiments with strong external validity. 1st ed.

abstract = {raises question of control, which is the same in govt as any large organization 

effectiveness of staff agencies is inverse to their size and specialization 

budget level (easy to cut) vs. efficiency (hard)

calls for profesionalization of bureacracy 



A T the outset, it may be well to ex-plain what the word {\&}dquo;bureaucracy{\&}dquo; means to me. In my vocabulary it does not serve as a swear word-a label for the quintessence of all I dislike about government-but as an approximate synonym for large-scale organization. In this, I think I conform to the origi-nal meariing of the term, although hardly to current popular usage. And I assume that the neutral sense of the term is intended in the title of this volume. Big Government, along with auto-mobiles and the atom bomb, is here to stay. It is conceivable, although not probable, that Big Government may become Slightly Smaller Government by decreasing in scale from hundreds of billions of dollars to tens of billions, but it will not become Small Govern-ment. As in the case of other natural phenomena, it needs more to be ex-plained, understood and dealt with, than to be bemoaned. And it can even be strongly argued that a large part of the bemoaning is based on misinformation as to how Big Government operates in our country. Large-scale organization inevitably creates problems of control. In every organization in our society there is al-ways some person or group of persons whom we regard as having the legiti-mate right to determine the organiza-tion's program and the way the pro-gram is carried out. In business con-cerns, the legitimate right of control rests with the stockholders; in govern-ment, with the citizens. The problem of control is the problem of imple-menting that right. The board of di-rectors in business concerns and the legislature in governments are formal devices whose main concern is the im-plementation of the right of control, and these are supplemented by many other devices, formal and informal-political parties are an example. The problem of control is a serious one in large-scale organization because of two related facts: (1) those who legitimately control it simply cannot cope with its size-they have time neither to find out in detail what is going on nor to decide what should go on; (2) the employees in the bureauc-racy may use this absence of account-ability to further their own purposes, which may not be the purposes of the legitimate controllers. There is nothing about this situation that is peculiar to government. The executives of any large business spend most of their time dealing with these same problems: se-curing adequate motivation of manual workers and middle-level executives and supervisors, securing co-ordination of goals and activities, combating the ve-nality of employees who are tempted to steal tools or accept bribes from vendors. The phenomena we call {\&}dquo;corruption,{\&}dquo; {\&}dquo;confusion,{\&}dquo; and {\&}dquo;inefficiency{\&}dquo; in large-scale organization are the symptoms of the inadequacies of the control process. And the phenomena we call {\&}dquo;red tape{\&}dquo; are largely the unintended effects of our attempts to strengthen the controls by formalizing the procedures for co-ordi-nation, communication, and review. {\&}dquo;Red tape{\&}dquo; is, so to speak, the sec-ondary reaction produced by the sulfa drugs we have prescribed for the pri-mary infection of lack of control.},

abstract = {AbstractThe complex and globalized nature of many industries has led to a global governance deficit that has resulted in the rise of self-regulation by private firms. Despite well-developed body of literature, we know little about the interaction of private regulation and public governance. The questions this paper addresses are: How do private self-regulatory programs either fill a vacuum of regulation or complement existing regulatory structures, and how do these programs support or crowd out the development of government regulatory programs? This paper addresses these questions by developing case studies of internal audit, voluntary reporting, and data analysis programs operated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The results suggest that when there is a congruence of goals between industry and government, private regulatory programs can complement or even replace existing public sector regulatory regimes. Additionally, the results suggest that successful private self-regulatory prog...},

The editors issued an open call for submissions of manuscripts that contained no mention of their actual results, incentivizing reviewers to evaluate manuscripts based on their theoretical contributions, research designs, and analysis plans. The three papers in this special issue are the result of this process that began with 19 submissions. In this article, we describe the rationale for this pilot, expressly articulating the practices of preregistration and results-free review. We document the process of carrying out the special issue with a discussion of the three accepted papers, and critically evaluate the role of both preregistration and results-free review. Our main conclusions are that results-free review encourages much greater attention to theory and research design, but that it raises thorny problems about how to anticipate and interpret null findings.

abstract = {We develop two methods of automated content analysis that give approximately unbiased estimates of quantities of theoretical interest to social scientists. With a small sample of documents hand coded into investigator-chosen categories, our methods can give accurate estimates of the proportion of text documents in each category in a larger population. Existing methods successful at maximizing the percent of documents correctly classified allow for the possibility of substantial estimation bias in the category proportions of interest. Our first approach corrects this bias for any existing classifier, with no additional assumptions. Our second method estimates the proportions without the intermediate step of individual document classification, and thereby greatly reduces the required assumptions. For both methods, we also correct statistically, apparently for the first time, for the far less-than-perfect levels of inter-coder reliability that typically characterize human attempts to classify documents, an approach that will normally outperform even population hand coding when that is feasible. We illustrate these methods by tracking the daily opinions of millions of people about candidates for the 2008 presidential nominations in online blogs, data we introduce and make available with this article, and through evaluations in available corpora from other areas, including movie reviews, university web sites, and Enron emails. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods described.},

The gap between user needs and available tools leads to justified skepticism, and limits the adoption and effective use of computational approaches. We argue that enabling human-in-the-loop machine learning requires establishing users' trust in computer-assisted analysis. To this aim, we introduce our ongoing work on analysis tools for interac-tively exploring the space of available topic models. To aid tool development, we propose two studies to examine how a computer-aided workflow affects the un-covered codes, and how machine-generated codes impact analysis outcome.

Still, the unique role that interest groups play in policy diffusion networks is not fully understood, in large part because the current methodology for studying diffusion cannot parse out interest group influence. We address this problem by analyzing the actual text of legislation, moving away from binary adoption to a more nuanced measure of policy similarity. This allows us to distinguish whether states emulate other states or interest group model legislation. We use text similarity scores in a social network analysis to explore whether early-adopting states or interest groups are more central to the network. We apply this analytical framework to two policies—abortion insurance coverage restrictions and self-defense statutes. Based on this analysis, we find that a fundamentally different picture of policy diffusion networks begins to emerge—one where interest group model legislation plays a central role in the diffusion of innovations.},

To do this, we have devised a system to locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and censor (i.e., remove from the Internet) the subset they deem objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future—and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Second, it examines how redistricting influences electoral competition, focusing on the alleged power of partisans and incumbents to draw maps that eliminate all but token opposition. Third and last, it discusses the issues surrounding the redistricting process itself and how various procedural reforms may influence political outcomes. Although significant progress has been made in understanding how different redistricting schemes create various biases in the electoral system, a review of the literature shows that major questions have not been resolved regarding the effects of redistricting on electoral competition, partisan polarization, and representation of communities of interest, especially minorities. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence from empirical research to justify any particular reform of the redistricting process. In addition to filling these gaps, future work might also broaden the scope of research to assess how redistricting affects other aspects of democracy, including political participation, efficacy, and trust.},

Politicians' preferences reflect their own views and their information that, when aggregated via intraparty deliberations, influences the party manifesto. By joining a faction, a politician increases the influence of its leader on the manifesto, but foregoes his individual bargaining power. For broad model specifications, we find that a faction formation process allows power to be transferred to moderate politicians. This facilitates information sharing, increasing the capacity of the party to attain its objective. These positive welfare effects may hold even when factionalism restricts intraparty dialogue, and hold a fortiori when information is freely exchanged across factions. We conclude that the existence of ideological factions may benefit a party: It provides a means to tie uninformed or extremist politicians to more moderate and informed faction leaders.},

abstract = {It is usually assumed that the cost of abating pollution is the main deterrent of business groups' support for international climate cooperation. Thus, it is often argued that, due to the burden of pollution abatement, businesses commonly constrain states' positions on global climate agreements. In this article I suggest that this argument needs further qualification: pollution-related costs rarely have unconditional effects on preferences for global climate agreements. Instead, I claim that pollution is more likely to influence preferences for climate cooperation when trade exposure is high. If pollution is high, high-trade firms should be less able to absorb climate regulation that bares on costs of production, and hence they should be more sensitive to climate cooperation. Vice versa, if pollution is low, high-trading firms should support climate cooperation, because by being more efficient they may be more capable of adjusting to regulation and profiting from trade-induced economies of scale. I test my argument with original data from business statements and national communications at the United Nations climate negotiations. In line with my argument, I find that businesses in trade open sectors are more likely to oppose climate agreement as their sector's emissions increase. I also find that in countries where high-emission sectors are open to trade governments have low preferences for climate cooperation. The findings have implications for the domestic politics of environmental agreements and the distributive politics of global public good provision. Ward, among others. I am also grateful to the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for enabling the data collection. Political scientists often discuss the role that economic interest groups play in international politics and their attitudes towards global governance. In this regard, the political economy scholarship has been critical for conceptualising the determinants of business groups' inclinations for global policy and their impact on international economic organizations. 1 Nonetheless, the motivations of domestic economic actors in other areas of international cooperation are little},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in experiments where outcomes are measured by surveys and treatments are delivered by a separate mechanism in the real world, such as by mailers, door-to-door canvasses, phone calls, or online ads. However, common designs for such experiments are often prohibitively expensive, vulnerable to bias, and raise ethical concerns. We show how four methodological practices currently uncommon in such experiments have previously undocumented complementarities that can dramatically relax these constraints when at least two are used in combination: (1) online surveys recruited from a defined sampling frame (2) with at least one baseline wave prior to treatment (3) with multiple items combined into an index to measure outcomes and, (4) when possible, a placebo control. We provide a general and extensible framework that allows researchers to determine the most efficient mix of these practices in diverse applications. Two studies then examine how these practices perform empirically. First, we examine the representativeness of online panel respondents recruited from a defined sampling frame and find that their representativeness compares favorably to phone panel respondents. Second, an original experiment successfully implements all four practices in the context of a door-to-door canvassing experiment. We conclude discussing potential extensions.},

Historically, most explanations for political participation have focused on characteristics of individuals. Although these individual-level correlates do a ?pretty good? job of predicting who participates, incorporating social networks deepens our understanding of the factors that lead people to express voice in the democratic process. Even though the participation literature has long been split between scholars who favor a focus on individuals and others who emphasize social networks, the two approaches need not be in tension. Instead, they complement one another. The individualistic factors known to correlate with participation?including education, religious attendance, political knowledge, political conviction, and civic duty?all have a social dimension.},

@article{Habyarimana2007,
abstract = {A large and growing literature links high levels of ethnic diversity to low levels of public goods provision. Yet although the empirical connection between ethnic heterogeneity and the underprovision of public goods is widely accepted, there is little consensus on the specific mechanisms through which this relationship operates. We identify three families of mechanisms that link diversity to public goods provision—what we term “preferences,” “technology,” and “strategy selection” mechanisms—and run a series of experimental games that permit us to compare the explanatory power of distinct mechanisms within each of these three families. Results from games conducted with a random sample of 300 subjects from a slum neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda, suggest that successful public goods provision in homogenous ethnic communities can be attributed to a strategy selection mechanism: in similar settings, co-ethnics play cooperative equilibria, whereas non-co-ethnics do not. In addition, we find evidence for a technology mechanism: co-ethnics are more closely linked on social networks and thus plausibly better able to support cooperation through the threat of social sanction. We find no evidence for prominent preference mechanisms that emphasize the commonality of tastes within ethnic groups or a greater degree of altruism toward co-ethnics, and only weak evidence for technology mechanisms that focus on the impact of shared ethnicity on the productivity of teams.

@article{Levitt2007,
abstract = {E conomists have increasingly turned to the experimental model of the physical sciences as a method to understand human behavior. Peer-reviewed articles using the methodology of experimental economics were almost nonexistent until the mid-1960s and surpassed 50 annually for the first time in 1982; and by 1998, the number of experimental papers published per year exceeded 200 (Holt, 2006). Lab experiments allow the investigator to influence the set of prices, budget sets, information sets, and actions available to actors, and thus measure the impact of these factors on behavior within the context of the labora-tory. The allure of the laboratory experimental method in economics is that, in principle, it provides ceteris paribus observations of individual economic agents, which are otherwise difficult to obtain. A critical assumption underlying the interpretation of data from many labo-ratory experiments is that the insights gained in the lab can be extrapolated to the world beyond, a principle we denote as generalizability. For physical laws and processes like gravity, photosynthesis, and mitosis, the evidence supports the idea that what happens in the lab is equally valid in the broader world. The American astronomer Harlow Shapley (1964, p. 43), for instance, noted that " as far as we can tell, the same physical laws prevail everywhere. " In this manner, astronomers are able to infer the quantity of certain gases in the Sunflower galaxy, for example, from observations of signature wavelengths of light emitted from that galaxy. The basic strategy underlying laboratory experiments in the physical sciences and economics is similar, but the fact that humans are the object of study in the latter raises special questions about the ability to extrapolate experimental findings beyond the lab, questions that do not arise in the physical sciences. While few scientists would argue that observation influences whether Uranium 239 would emit beta particles and turn into Neptunium, human behavior may be sensitive to a variety of factors that systematically vary between the lab and the outside world. In particular, we argue, based on decades of research in psychology and recent findings in experi-mental economics, that behavior in the lab is influenced not just by monetary calculations, but also by at least five other factors: 1) the presence of moral and ethical considerations; 2) the nature and extent of scrutiny of one's actions by others; 3) the context in which the decision is embedded; 4) self-selection of the individuals making the decisions; and 5) the stakes of the game. The remainder of this paper is devoted to examining how each of these factors influences decision making and the extent to which the environment constructed in the lab does or does not conform to real-world interactions on these various dimensions.},

Congress and some newer media outlets have added more partisan messages to a continuing supply of mostly centrist news. Al-though political attitudes of most Americans have remained fairly moderate, evidence points to some polarization among the politically involved. Prolif-eration of media choices lowered the share of less interested, less partisan voters and thereby made elections more partisan. But evidence for a causal link between more partisan messages and changing attitudes or behaviors is mixed at best. Measurement problems hold back research on partisan selec-tive exposure and its consequences. Ideologically one-sided news exposure may be largely confined to a small, but highly involved and influential, seg-ment of the population.

@article{Sinclair,
abstract = {Interpersonal communication presents a methodological challenge and a research opportunity for researchers involved in field experiments. The challenge is that communication among subjects blurs the line between treatment and control conditions. When treatment effects are transmitted from subject to subject, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is violated, and comparison of treatment and control outcomes may provide a biased assessment of the treatment's causal influence. Social scientists are increasingly interested in the substantive phenomena that lead to SUTVA violations, such as communication in advance of an election. Experimental designs that gauge SUTVA violations provide useful insights into the extent and influence of interpersonal communication. This article illustrates the value of one such design, a multilevel experiment in which treatments are randomly assigned to individuals and varying proportions of their neighbors. After describing the theoretical and statistical underpinnings of this design, we apply it to a large-scale voter-mobilization experiment conducted in Chicago during a special election in 2009 using social-pressure mailings that highlight individual electoral participation. We find some evidence of within-household spillovers but no evidence of spillovers across households. We conclude by discussing how multilevel designs might be employed in other substantive domains, such as the study of deterrence and policy diffusion. M any randomized field experiments take place within social settings, where individuals may influence each other's tastes, beliefs, and be-haviors. Communication between participants, band-wagon effects, and other social psychological processes may violate what Rubin (1986) has termed the " stable unit treatment value assumption " (SUTVA), which is routinely invoked when drawing causal inferences about experimental effects.},

Coupled with publication and related biases, this latitude raises the concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally select models that yield positive findings, leading to an unreliable body of published research. To combat this " fishing " problem in medical studies, leading journals now require pre-registration of designs that emphasize the prior identification of dependent and independent variables. However, we demonstrate here that even with this level of advanced specification, the scope for fishing is considerable when there is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing field experiment for which we drafted a complete " mock report " of findings using fake data on treatment assignment. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of this form of registration and propose that a comprehensive but nonbinding approach be adopted as a first step to combat fishing by social scientists. Likely effects of comprehensive but nonbinding registration are discussed, the principal advantage being communication rather than commit-ment, in particular that it generates a clear distinction between exploratory analyses and genuine tests.},

Similar programmes are appearing in other sectors. Developed largely by environmental NGOs and industry associations rather than governments, forest certification programmes are nominally voluntary, but are becoming increasingly mandatory in practice. They are also gradually linking with government regulatory and management programmes in various ways, while remaining in tension both with each other and with government programmes. The overall regulatory system is thus highly dynamic, as the programmes compete with each other for business and also with government regulatory programmes for public acceptance. This paper describes and assesses the administrative law – i.e., the requirements for rule-making and rule application – of the emerging global forest regulatory system. It finds that while the certification programmes are becoming increasingly transparent and participatory, often comparing favourably with government programmes, some of them still need considerable improvement and all of them face serious challenges. It concludes with a discussion of the problem of accountability,},

It shows that lobbying firms' partisan identities provide informative signals about lobbyists' loyalties. Using data from lobbying records released under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, as well as original data collected on lobbying firms, this article examines the effects of partisan ties on firms' lobbying revenues. The results demonstrate that partisan ties with the majority party of the House of Representatives translate into higher lobbying revenues, but ties with the Senate's majority party make no significant difference for revenue. These findings provide evidence of the political market value of partisan ties, as well as evidence of perceived differences in the institutional vulnerability of the House and Senate to interest group pressure.},

Indeed political appointments were more effective than budget changes, legislation, expressions of Congressional preference, and agency reorganization (822) in controlling agency action.

Specifically, OMB review can open up a pathway for interest groups to lobby for policy change. We theorize that interest group lobbying can be influential during OMB review, especially when there is consensus across groups. We use a selection model to test our argument with more than 1,500 regulations written by federal agencies that were subjected to OMB review. We find that lobbying is associated with change during OMB review. We also demonstrate that, when only business groups lobby, we are more likely to see rule change; however, the same is not true for public interest groups. We supplement these results with illustrative examples suggesting that interest groups can, at times, use OMB review to influence the content of legally binding government regulations.},

We theorise that the breadth of the congressional statutory delegation drives the timing of agency policy production. In particular, when Congress expressly tells an agency to promulgate a rule, we expect agencies to do so quickly. Yet, when Congress provides greater policymaking discretion to agencies, we expect other factors – and especially, internal agency considerations – to drive regulatory timing. We use data from almost 350 statutes spanning four decades, which are then matched up with thousands of regulations, to assess the argument. Using innovative methods, we find support for our hypotheses. Overall, we produce a deeper understanding of the link between delegation and discretion: suggesting when it occurs, as well as, importantly, why.}},

We use the topic model to examine the agenda in the U.S. Senate from 1997 to 2004. Using a new database of over 118,000 speeches (70,000,000 words) from the Congressional Record, our model reveals speech topic categories that are both distinctive and meaningfully interrelated and a richer view of democratic agenda dynamics than had previously been possible.},

Knowing how benefits are distributed and who wins and who loses in American politics requires understanding the functioning of local representative democracy. Pitkin (1967) delineates three components to democratic representation?authorization, responsiveness, and accountability. Elections play a fundamental role in each of these processes, from selecting government officials, to influencing the policies governments choose, to holding representatives accountable for outcomes. Scholars of local politics have tended toward two themes in analyzing the link between elections and representation: exploring the role of race and ethnicity, and understanding how institutions shape both practices and outcomes. Racial and ethnic divisions are prominent in local politics and shape both voting decisions and policy outcomes. Institutions implemented by municipal reformers tend to decrease the visibility of politics and in some situations advantage white, middle/upper-class residents. This review presents the research on both themes, discussing each of Pitkin's components of representation in turn, with the goal of summarizing what we know and what we still need to learn.},

abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Scholarship on bureaucratic responsiveness to Congress typically focuses on delegation and formal oversight hearings. Overlooked are daily requests to executive agencies made by legislators that propose policies, communicate concerns, and request information or services. Analyzing over 24,000 of these requests made to 13 executive agencies between 2007-2014, I find agencies systematically prioritize the policy-related requests of majority party legislators-but that this effect can be counteracted when presidents politicize agencies through appointments. An increase in politicization produces a favorable agency bias toward presidential co-partisans. This same politicization, however, has a net negative impact on agency responsiveness-agencies are less responsive to members of Congress, but even less responsive to legislators who are not presidential co-partisans. Critically, this negative impact extends beyond policy-related requests to cases of constituency service. The results suggest that presidential appointees play an important, daily mediating role between Congress and the bureaucracy.},

abstract = {This paper raises a question that is little-discussed yet central to lawmaking and policy im-plementation in the American separation-of-powers system: Under what conditions is Congress unable to induce compliance in contemporary statutory implementation by administrative agen-cies? Unlike a number of existing delegation models, the paper holds that variation in insti-tutional conflict and oversight of agencies fundamentally reshape agencies' latitude as active policymakers. I answer this question in the context of the Environmental Protection Agency from 1973-2010 using an extensive original dataset on noncompliance using the hand-coding of several thousand congressional bill introductions and several hundred DC Circuit court cases. I use these data to test the separation-of-powers theories concerning the effects of legislative-executive conflict and legislative division on agencies' regulatory compliance, as well as the effect of third-party oversight through litigation. The study provides the first systematic em-pirical analysis of the extent to which Congress is unable to successfully induce compliance when delegating, providing support for the core inter-branch conflict hypotheses. Ting provided helpful comments and suggestions. I am especially indebted to Sean Farhang and Greg Wawro for their detailed comments on multiple versions of the paper.

Undertaking a textual analysis that compares model bills with bills introduced and enacted in the states from 1995-2014, I detect the use of model bills in state legislatures. My dataset of model bills comes from a number of groups across the ideological spectrum. Using these data, I test predictions derived from a model of strategic interaction between a group and legislature under varying legislative resources, ideological distance, and policy area complexity. I use variation across legislative bodies (professionalism and term limits) and across legislators (length of service in the state legislature) within those chambers to test the claims that legislators under greater resource constraints than their counterparts rely more heavily upon model legislation given the accessibility and ease of introducing a prepackaged bill.},

abstract = {Numerous get-out-the-vote (GOTV) interventions are successful in raising voter turnout. However, these increases may not be evenly distributed across the electorate and could potentially increase the differences between voters and nonvoters. By analyzing individual level-data, we reassess previous GOTV experiments to determine which interventions mobilize under-represented citizens versus those who regularly turn out. We develop a generalized and exportable test which indicates whether a particular intervention reduces or exacerbates disparities in political participation and apply it to 24 previous experimental interventions. On average, current mobilization strategies significantly widen disparities in participation by mobilizing high-propensity individuals more than the under-represented, low-propensity citizens. The results hold troubling implications for the study and improvement of political inequality, but the methodological procedures laid out in this study may assist the development and testing of future strategies which reverse this pattern. S cholars are increasingly interested in inequalities in political participation and their consequences for political outcomes (APSA Task Force 2004; Bartels 2008, 2009; Dahl 2006; Gilens 2005, 2012; Schlozman, Verba, and Brady 2012). 1 At the same time, political scientists increasingly use large-scale field experiments to test methods for increasing polit-ical participation. The findings of these experiments have been adopted by political campaigns and are an increasingly important feature of electoral politics (Gerber et al. 2011; Green and Gerber 2008; Issenberg 2010, 2012). Often (but not always), a goal of these get-out-the-vote (GOTV) strategies is to reduce the participation gap—the extent to which the electorate differs from the voting-eligible population. While many experiments successfully increase average levels of voter participation, they may not affect all citizens equally. Instead, an experiment may affect the types of citizens already represented in the political process more than underrepresented citizens. In this article, we explicitly test whether GOTV treatments tend to reduce or exac-erbate the gap in political participation. We find that GOTV interventions, on average, tend to magnify the participation gap. This finding is widely important for the study and equalization of political representation, political campaigns, and voting behavior. In a typical GOTV experiment, a researcher will randomly assign individuals, households, or geo-graphic regions to receive a particular treatment. Then, the researcher will typically collect voting data from public records and estimate the average effect of the treatment on voter turnout by calculating a simple difference-in-means. To our knowledge, there are four primary motivations for conducting GOTV experi-ments. First, scholars and civic groups may want to increase political participation as an end in and of itself. Second, field experiments can improve the efficiency of political campaigns. Third, these experi-ments might inform the study of voting behavior and human behavior in general. Fourth, the participation gap may hold critical political and policy outcomes, and GOTV experiments can identify methods for reducing this gap. For all but the first motivation, the traditional GOTV analysis of calculating average},

I argue that ex post lobbying aims to influence the distribution of particularistic benefits that will arise from legislation by targeting regulatory rule-making processes. I develop a model that describes lobbying as a collective action problem among interest groups, who must trade off between spending money to lobby for a bill’s passage and spending money to lobby over the details of its implementation. The implications of the model suggest that bills with high proportions of particularistic provisions draw more ex post lobbying and that trade associations and larger firms bear a disproportionately large share of the ex ante lobbying burden. Empirical analysis of lobbying reports is consistent with these predictions. },

Key is that notwithstanding problems with the lacking legal framework of global regulation and enforceability, patterns of local self-regulation, norm-setting, and international codes lead not only to higher expectations of the behavior of transnationally operating firms but also to an indirect pattern of regulation. The article argues that particularly the adoption of the core labor standards by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the setup of the Global Compact by the UN serve as points of convergence.

abstract = {"Users of this or any edition are warned that the textual variants presented by citations from Plato in later literature have not yet been as fully investigated as is desirable". This shortcoming, characterized by Kenneth Dover (Dover, 1980) is still existent and is unlikely to be corrected quickly by traditional research techniques. Textual reuse plays an important role in Classical Studies research. Similar to modern publications, classical authors used the texts of others as sources for their own work. In ancient texts, however, a less stronger form of word by word citation can be observed. Additionally, the complexity of ancient resources disallows fully manual research. From a bird's eye view there are different points of view to the problem of textual reuse implying different research interests (B{\"{u}}chler and Ge{\ss}ner, 2009): -A Computer Science perspective focuses on algorithms (technical view): Which algorithm is better than others? The scope of this research is wide ranging and also relates to plagiarism detection in modern texts like theses at universities (Potthast et al., 2009). -A Historian is interested in more complex correlations (macro view). For this kind of work a dedicated user interface is necessary to figure out relations between e.g. chapters of a book and their citation usage on a timeline. -The research interests of a Classical Philologist focus on the textual differences between the original text and its variants in citations (micro view). These varying requirements necessitate designing different user interfaces for these three kinds of researchers. Within the eAQUA project we are investigating the reception of Plato as a case study of textual reuse in ancient Greek texts. Our research is carried out in two steps. On the technical level, we firstly extract word by word citations. This is achieved by combining syntactical ngram overlappings (Hose, 2009 and B{\"{u}}chler, 2008) and significant terms for several of Plato's works. In the second step the constraints on syntactic word order are relaxed. This is done by combining text mining and information retrieval techniques. A graph based approach is then introduced that can deal with free word order citations. The key concept is not syntactically based, but focuses on the semantic level to extract the relevant core information of a used citation. Then the information is represented as a formal graph that is similar to the Lexical Chaining approach (Waltinger et al. 2008) that is often used for text summarisation (Yu et al. 2007). On the one hand syntactical and semantic approaches are only used to select reuse candidates with a small set of uncommon matching words within a citation. On the other hand, a complete pairwise comparison of all of the nearly 5.5 million sentences in the TLG corpus would require approximately 1000 years due to the squared complexity of O(n 2) that was used for example to compare the Dead Sea Scrolls with the Hebrew Bible (Hose, 2009). For this reason, an intelligent pre-clustering of relevant reuse candidates is needed. Such a divide and conquer strategy reduces the complexity dramatically. Whilst the},

I evaluate this in the context of the Environmental Protection Agency from 1973 to 2010 using a rich new dataset comprising the 2,000 statutory amendments to the legislation under the jurisdiction of the EPA, each of which is hand-coded to determine the magnitude of the congressional revision, as well as the DC Circuit cases in which the agency was the defendant.

We hypothesize that opposition hinges on the explicitness of the race-targeting and whether the policy's goal is opportunity enhancement or equality of outcomes. We also hypothesize that the influence of individuals' self-interest, beliefs about inequality, and racial attitudes on opinions differs by whether or not a policy is race-targeted and by a policy's goal. We use data from the 1990 General Social Survey to analyze opinion toward race-targeted versus income-targeted opportunity-enhancing policies and toward race-targeted versus income-targeted equal outcomes policies. Results of these analyses lend general support to our hypotheses, and in particular, underscore the influence of group self-interest and perceived discrimination on white opposition to race-targeted policy.},

As the Roosevelt Administra-tion rushed to align domestic affairs with American geostrategic priorities at the outset of World War II, it confronted a host of now largely forgotten legal and organizational challenges. These ranged from a federal income tax base that encompassed less than ten percent of the labor force to unresolved legal questions about the scope of agencies' power to issue subpoenas. For policy-makers, organized interests, and the public, these challenges created uncer-tainty about the success of mobilization and the scale of the changes that the Administration would pursue. In response, the Administration and its legisla-tive supporters made strategic choices to expand the administrative state with-out pursuing direct public control of industry. They created agencies such as the War Production Board, the Office of Price Administration, and the Office},

As a whole, the recent literature provides a more complete and nuanced picture of the retrospective voter as sometimes, but not always, effectively incentivizing elected officials to enhance public welfare. Leveraging examples of retro-spective voting in areas other than the economy, the field is heading toward a middle ground in which voters resemble decision makers in many other domains. In many cases, a coherent logic governs voters' choices. In other instances, voters make mistakes, often in predictable ways subject to well-known psychological biases. Understanding the circumstances under which retrospective voting achieves effective democratic accountability and when it fails to do so is an important task for subsequent research. We discuss two additional issues for future exploration: a better understanding of normative benchmarks, and increased attention to the relationship between retrospec-tive voting behavior and policy outcomes.},

abstract = {An underappreciated way members of Congress represent interests is by pursuing policy goals through their communica-tion with the bureaucracy. I argue that the bureaucracy provides an alternative, covert way for cross-pressured legislators, who face diverging pressures from party leaders, interest groups, and subconstituencies, to satisfy conflicting interests. Using original data of senators' communication with the US Department of Labor from 2005 to 2012 (109th through 112th Con-gresses), I show that, when faced with cross-pressures from party and constituency, senators strategically choose less visible, back-channel means for pursuing policy goals. These findings provide a new perspective on representation by demonstrat-ing that legislators pursue policy goals outside of the legislative process in an effort to evade accountability. I n the summer of 2005, Senators Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr, both first-term Republican senators representing North Carolina, encountered a dilemma. The US–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) was about to come up for a vote. Republicans in Congress faced pressure and intense lobbying from the Bush administration and leadership of the GOP-controlled Congress to vote the party line and pass CAFTA (Funk 2005). However, Senators Dole and Burr struggled with the vote given CAFTA's potential harm to North Caro-lina's textile industry. Adding to the contention, the decline of the state's man-ufacturing industry in previous years had been blamed largely on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which had become a heated issue during Dole and Burr's previous cam-paigns (Morrill 2002; Morrill and Johnson 2004). The sen-ators, along with many of their Republican colleagues, faced the conflict of partisan pressure versus state interests. This conflict was particularly sharp for senators in swing states like North Carolina, where large segments of the constituency did not share their partisan affiliation. In the end, the senators voted for CAFTA despite the potential damage to the state's textile industry. However, their attention to CAFTA did not end with the vote in 2005. 1 The senators later wrote a joint letter to the US Department of Labor requesting that the sock industry, im-portant to their home state, receive protection from CAFTA via an increase of the duty on socks imported from Honduras. About three months after the senators sent the letter, the administration announced it would be increasing the duty on Honduras's socks.},

Yet, the design of classical survey experiments prevents them from identifying which components of a multidimensional treatment are influential. Here, we show how conjoint analysis, an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.},

@article{Heinzerling2017,
abstract = {With three recent decisions – UARG v. EPA, King v. Burwell, and Michigan v. EPA – the Supreme Court has embraced a new trio of canons of statutory interpretation. When an agency charged with administering a long-existing statute asserts regulatory authority it has not previously used, in a matter having large economic and political significance, its interpretation will be met with skepticism. When an agency charged with administering an ambiguous statutory provision answers a question of large economic and political significance, one central to the statutory regime, and the Court believes the agency is not an expert in the matter, the Court may ignore the agency's interpretation altogether. And when an agency charged with administering a statute interprets an ambiguous provision to permit the agency not to consider costs before deciding to regulate, the agency will likely lose as having acted unreasonably. In each of these cases, the Court put Congress on notice that it would need to speak clearly if it wanted to give administrative agencies interpretive authority over certain kinds of decisions. In each case, the Court took interpretive power from an administrative agency, power that would normally have been the agency's due under Chevron, and kept it for itself. And in each case, the Court's seizure of power aligned with its basic distrust of an active administrative state. I call the new canons the "power canons." The power canons are both normative and new. They are normative canons, not descriptive or linguistic canons, insofar as they are not based on a meaningful assessment of what Congress likely intended to accomplish by using particular statutory language. The canons are also new. Although two of them draw upon previous decisions alluding to the significance (in two different senses) of an interpretive question as a factor in statutory interpretation, the recent cases both resuscitate that factor after intervening cases had signaled its demise and add new, distinctive parameters. The third canon, on regulatory costs, is utterly new. As normative canons, the power canons must be normatively justified, and the justification must spring from something other than, and more than, judges' own political preferences. Yet the Supreme Court made essentially no effort to lay normative foundations for its new trio of canons. Borrowing from Professor Eskridge's normative framework for evaluating interpretive canons, I argue here that the power canons undermine rather than uphold important normative values. Their unpredictability and subjectivity upset rule-of-law values. Indeed, the asymmetrical thrust of the power canons – pushing statutory regimes away from responsiveness and dynamism, and toward regulatory passivity – is, more than their dilution of Chevron deference, their core problem. The blunt approach of the power canons also ignores details of statutory history and design and thus their application drives a wedge between legislative objectives and judicial outcomes. They undermine the public values of separation of powers and deliberation by enlarging the judicial power at the expense of the legislative and executive branches and by leaning hard against one side of the ongoing debate over the appropriate scope of regulatory power. The Supreme Court should renounce the power canons.},

@article{N.Rouder2009,
abstract = {Advances in science often come from identifying invariances—those elements that stay constant when oth-ers change. Kepler, for example, described the motion of planets. From an Earth-bound vantage point, planets seem to have strange and variable orbits. Not only do they differ in their speeds and locations, they even appear to back-track at times (a phenomenon known as retrograde mo-tion). Although planetary orbits appear variable, Kepler identified invariants in planetary motion. For example, all orbits follow ellipses in which the square of the orbital pe-riod is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. These invariances formed the basis for Newton's subsequent the-ory of mechanics (Hawking, 2002). A similar story holds in genetics, where Mendel's discovery of invariant ratios in phenotypes served as an important precursor for the construction of genetic theory. Although the search for invariances has often motivated theory in other domains, it has not had as much impact in psychology. Invariances are statements of equality, sameness, or lack of association, whereas in practice, the psychological field has a Popperian orientation, in which demonstrations of effects or associations are valued more than demonstrations of invariances (Meehl, 1978). As a contrast, we offer below a few examples of how scientific inquiry in cognitive psychology has benefited from con-sideration of invariances: 1. It is often of great practical and theoretical interest to determine whether performance is invariant to readily ob-servable variables. For example, several researchers have assessed whether cognitive skills vary with gender (e.g., Shibley Hyde, 2005, 2007). To believe that only effects of genders, rather than invariances across genders, will appear in performance strikes us as an extreme position. A second example comes from the domain of subliminal priming (see, e.g., Dehaene et al., 1998): To prove that subliminal priming occurs, it must be shown that detection or identification of the primes does not vary from chance (see Reingold {\&} Merikle, 1988; Rouder, Morey, Speck-man, {\&} Pratte, 2007). 2. Conservation laws are instantiations of invariances. An example of a proposed conservation law is the Weber– Fechner law (Fechner, 1860/1966), which states that the detectability of a briefly flashed stimulus is a function of its intensity divided by the intensity of the background. Accordingly, performance should be invariant when the intensities of the flash and background are multiplied by the same constant. Another example of a proposed conser-vation law is the choice rule (Clarke, 1957; Luce, 1959; Shepard, 1957), which states that the preference for a choice is a function of the ratio of its utility divided by the summed utility of all available choices. The key in-variance here concerns ratios of preferences between any two choices—for example, the preference for Choice A divided by that for Choice B. This ratio should not vary when choices are added or taken away from the set of available options. 3. Testing invariances is critical for validating paramet-ric descriptions. Consider the example of Stevens (1957), who proposed that sensation follows a power function of intensity. It is reasonable to expect that the exponent of 225},

In a wide range of settings NGO entry and competition results in too many labels being adopted, with each label being too stringent. Compared to a setting in which firms can credibly communicate the social attributes of their products, labels demand greater prosocial behavior than is desired by firms, although with proliferation of the number of labels this discrepancy disappears.

abstract = {Electronic rulemaking, or "e-rulemaking," began in the federal government within individual agencies in the mid-to late 1990s, but current government-wide initiatives can be traced to both congressional and presidential sources. For example, the E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies, "to the extent practicable," to accept public comments on their rules electronically and to ensure that one or more federal websites contains those comments and other materials normally maintained in rulemaking dockets. E-rulemaking is also one of about two dozen e-government initiatives launched as part of the George W. Bush Administration's President's Management Agenda. In the first phase of the initiative, the Administration established a website through which the public can identify all federal rules that are open for comment and provide comments on those rules. The second phase involves the creation of a government-wide docket system that can allow the public to review rulemaking materials (e.g., agencies' legal and cost-benefit analyses for their rules) and the comments of others. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead agency for the e-rulemaking initiative. E-rulemaking has been described as a way to increase democratic legitimacy, improve regulatory policy decisions, decrease administrative costs, and increase regulatory compliance. However, the implementation of e-rulemaking in the federal government has been controversial. Although the migration of agencies into the government-wide docket was originally planned for 2004, that migration is currently not expected to be completed until 2008. Congress has objected to how e-rulemaking and several other e-government projects have been funded (through appropriations transfers or reimbursements to the projects' "managing partner" agencies), and has voiced other concerns about the overall management and appropriateness of the initiatives. Questions have also been raised regarding the e-rulemaking initiative's centralized structure, its costs (more than {\$}53 million spent through FY2008) and expected financial benefits, the functionality of some of the applications being used, and its effect on public participation in the rulemaking process. The reasons why the federal e-rulemaking initiative has had such a difficult first five years are many, but one appears to be the lack of direct, consistent funding. From FY2003 through FY2007, Congress appropriated less than {\$}20 million to the E-Government Fund for all e-government projects-much less than the {\$}345 million authorized in the E-Government Act for that period. Congress has also required approval by the Appropriations Committees before any transfers or reimbursements of appropriations are made. Although some have suggested that better communication is needed between Congress and the executive branch, the recent conflicts may reflect basic differences of opinion between the two branches regarding control of federal operations and how the branches should interact. A long-term issue is whether e-rulemaking should continue to be housed in EPA. This report will be updated as appropriate to reflect changes in the e-rulemaking initiative.},

abstract = {High levels of partisan polarization are a defining feature of contemporary Congressional Parties. Much of the existing literature treats polarization as a dynamic between the two parties, relying on evidence such as the distance between the two parties' median roll call votes. A more comprehensive examination of polarization that includes other forms of legislative behavior, in particular elite statements, reveals how intra-party factionalism drives divisions between political parties. In this paper, we use text as data tools to analyze a new collection of legislators? press releases and newsletters from one of the most polarized era in Congressional history, the years spanning 2005 through 2012. 1 We find that polarized rhetoric, understood as hyperbolic criticism of the other party, is driven by factions of more ideologically extreme legislators. While the parties become more critical generally when the president is from the other party, this does not change the source of the polarized rhetoric. These findings suggest that polarization cannot be adequately understood without examining dynamics both within and between parties.},

Yet few scholars in American politics have been making use of these resources. This article reviews research on the politics of inequality within the United States and situates it more explicitly within an intellectual framework for the study of political economy. The article traces the decline of political economy research within mainstream scholarship on American politics and reviews the upsurge of interest in the politics of inequality. It develops a typology of distinct frameworks for analyzing the American political economy and for bringing greater intellectual organization to a growing but disparate body of research.},

abstract = {Since the publication of Pierson's seminal work, a scholarly debate about welfare state retrenchment has emerged. One of the debated issues has been the ''dependent variable problem'': what is welfare state retrenchment and how can it be measured. In particular the pros and cons of different types of data have been discussed. The argument of this article is that the ''dependent variable problem'' is a problem of theoretical conceptualization rather than a problem of data. It is crucial to be aware that different theoretical perspectives on retrenchment should lead to different conceptualizations of retrenchment. Furthermore, different conceptualizations lead to different evaluations of the same changes in welfare schemes, just as the question of which data to use depends very much on the theoretical conceptualization of retrenchment.},

A strategic activist seeks to transform the behavior of an industry, and influence it to adopt a costly green technology that will reduce environmental damages. To do so, the activist can mount a campaign to convince one or more firms in an industry to adopt the green technology. The activist considers both the direct environmental benefits of a firm's adoption, as well as its indirect effects through changes in the industry's lobbying behavior. We characterize the activist's optimal strategy and how it varies with underlying variables such as the cost of the alternative technologies, environmental benefits of technology adoption, and cost heterogeneity within the industry.},

This study presents a concept of rival private governance where multiple initiatives compete for rule-setting authority. Specifically, we argue that heterogeneous actors organize in network form to establish legitimacy of new sustainability governance fields. In an effort to preempt threats from these new fields of governance, nonparticipating actors create rival private governance networks and compete based on each network's ability to access unique relational assets from participants. Based on the cases of carbon off-set standards, green building rating systems and sustainable forestry certifications, we suggest that this competitive market vetting results in pressures toward the convergence of governance rules over time, but not a single winning set of rules. Our findings illustrate that multiple and competing networks can provide innovative, legitimate and dynamically evolving governance of sustainability, while presenting new challenges for public and private sector actors.},

abstract = {Abstract The new orthodoxy in studies of policy dynamics is that policy change occurs through a homeostatic process. “Perturbations” occurring outside of an institutionalized policy subsystem, often characterized as some type of societal or political upheaval or learning, are critical for explaining the development of profound and durable policy changes which are otherwise limited by “endogenous” institutional stability. These homeostatic assumptions, while useful for assessing many cases of policy change, do not adequately capture the historical patterns of policy development found in many sectors. The roots of this problem are traced back to the origins of the new orthodoxy in comparative policy research whereby different levels (orders) of policy making have been incorrectly juxtaposed, providing a parsimonious, but sometimes empirically incorrect, view of policy change. Revising existing taxonomies of policy levels provides a superior identification of the processes of change, and uncovers more than one mechanism through which significant policy change can occur. Three of these alternative mechanisms – a “neo-homeostatic” one in which paradigmatic changes occur through endogenous shifts in goals; a “quasi-homeostatic” in which exogenous factors influence changes in objectives and settings; and a “thermostatic” one in which durable policy objectives require that settings adapt to exogenous changes – are discussed.},

By examining three types of antismoking policy choices by the 675 largest U.S. cities between 1975 and 2000, we uncover robust patterns of policy diffusion, yielding three key findings. First, we distinguish among and find evidence for four mechanisms of policy diffusion: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate cities, imitation of larger cities, and coercion by state governments. Second, we find a temporal component to these effects, with imitation being a more short-lived diffusion process than the others. Third, we show that these mechanisms are conditional, with larger cities being better able to learn from others, less fearful of economic spillovers, and less likely to rely on imitation.},

abstract = {One possible reason for the continued neglect of statistical power analysis in research in the behavioral sciences is the inaccessibility of or difficulty with the standard material. A convenient, although not comprehensive, presentation of required sample sizes is provided here. Effect-size indexes and conventional values for these are given for operationally defined small, medium, and large effects. The sample sizes necessary for .80 power to detect effects at these levels are tabled for eight standard statistical tests: (a) the difference between independent means, (b) the significance of a product-moment correlation, (c) the difference between independent rs, (d) the sign test, (e) the difference between independent proportions, (f) chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contin-gency tables, (g) one-way analysis of variance, and (h) the significance of a multiple or multiple partial correlation. The preface to the first edition of my power handbook (Co-hen, 1969) begins: During my first dozen years of teaching and consulting on applied statistics with behavioral scientists, 1 became increasingly im-pressed with the importance of statistical power analysis, an im-portance which was increased an order of magnitude by its neglect in our textbooks and curricula. The case for its importance is easily made: What behavioral scientist would view with equanim-ity the question of the probability that his investigation would lead to statistically significant results, i.e., its power? (p. vii) This neglect was obvious through casual observation and had been confirmed by a power review of the 1960 volume of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, which found the mean power to detect medium effect sizes to be .48 (Cohen, 1962). Thus, the chance of obtaining a significant result was about that of tossing a head with a fair coin. I attributed this disregard of power to the inaccessibility of a meager and mathe-matically difficult literature, beginning with its origin in the work of Neyman and Pearson (1928,1933). The power handbook was supposed to solve the problem. It required no more background than an introductory psychologi-cal statistics course that included significance testing. The ex-position was verbal-intuitive and carried largely by many worked examples drawn from across the spectrum of behav-ioral science. In the ensuing two decades, the book has been through re-vised (1977) and second (1988) editions and has inspired dozens of power and effect-size surveys in many areas of the social and life sciences (Cohen, 1988, pp. xi-xii). During this period, there has been a spate of articles on power analysis in the social science literature, a baker's dozen of computer programs (},

abstract = {Solving conflictual environmental policy problems is increasingly falling under the purview of local governments and public agencies. Nonregulatory approaches, such as the development of voluntary environmental programs (VEPs), could offer a useful policy alternative as they often have greater political traction and flexibility. However, there has been little work examining the use of VEPs in the public sector. This article uses a new dataset from California to examine how political institutions affect decisions by local governments and public agencies to participate in a voluntary urban water conser- vation program and whether this program has improved the water conservation performance of its members. The results show that special district governments, private utilities, and water suppliers dependent on purchased water are more likely to participate in the program and to join early. However, urban water agencies that have joined the program have not reduced their per capita water use more than those that have not. These results underscore the influence of political institutions in public-sector decision making and demonstrate that, as in the private sector, commitment to a VEP by local government and public agencies does not guarantee implementation or environmental improvements. While voluntary programs offer political and administrative advantages, in order for VEPs in the public sector to be effective they must be accompanied and supported by credible enforcement mecha- nisms, performance standards, and rigorous monitoring programs.},

Intermediaries may communicate this knowledge to the regulator to strategically inform rule-reformulation.

Following an examination of the achievements and shortcomings of the forest regime to date, I argue that gaps could be filled by including a broad range of stakeholders in certification standards development; promoting strong environmental and social performance standards in forestry; providing effective control mechanisms; securing producer participation; and penetrating markets. Although the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was considered initially to have the greatest potential to fill these gaps, the emergence and widespread proliferation of industry-dominated schemes have marginalized the FSC in many countries. The study shows that while forest certification would probably promote more sustainable forestry in the temperate and boreal zones than it would in the tropical zone, the ability of this tool to actually do so remains to be seen.},

By January 2017, however, this idea was off the table. Congress did not wish to be seen as engaging in self-enrich-ment amid the chants to " drain the swamp. " Like any policy, the ban on earmarks comes with a cost — in this case, to the separation of powers and to the legislature's productivity. Our recent research on lettermarking found executive agencies and the president now have wide dis-cretion in the allocation of projects. 1 Additionally, a recent study by John Hudak of the Brookings Institution concluded former President Barack Obama used this new authority to shift federal spending to swing states during the 2012 elec-tion and to vulnerable democratic Senate candidates during the 2014 midterm elections.},

We then present evidence that leaders in the women's rights and reform campaigns of the nineteenth century were previously active in antislavery canvassing. Pivotal signers of the Seneca Falls Declaration were antislavery petition canvassers, and in an independent sample of post–Civil War activists, women were four times more likely than men to have served as identifiable antislavery canvassers.

I seek to unify formal theoretic expectations with empirical observation of campaigns by presenting a new measure of ideological modera-tion.

abstract = {When political action entails individual costs but group-contingent benefits, political participation may depend on an individual's perceptions of others' beliefs; yet, detailed empirical attention to these second-order beliefs – beliefs about the beliefs of others – remains rare. We offer the first comprehensive examination of the distribution and content of second-order climate beliefs in the United States and China, drawing from six new opinion surveys of mass publics, political elites, and intellectual elites. We demonstrate that all classes of political actors have second-order beliefs characterized by egocentric bias and global underestimation of pro-climate positions. We then demonstrate experimentally that individual support for pro-climate policies increases after respondents update their second-order beliefs. We conclude that scholars should focus more closely on second-order beliefs as a key factor shaping climate policy inaction and that scholars can use the climate case to extend their understanding of second-order beliefs more broadly. Political actors, from national governments to social movement leaders, often work to coordinate costly individual behaviors. Yet, many costly behaviors only provide individualized benefits after participation becomes widespread. For example, civil rights leaders mobilized citizens to engage in individually risky protests, even as the efficacy of these protests depended on the the number of individuals who participated.1 Alternatively, many national governments have enacted unilateral climate reforms even as the climatic impacts of these costly reforms depends on the joint efforts of all countries.2 When political action entails individual costs but group-contingent benefits, participation may require individuals to perceive themselves as members of a " community of fate " : a group of voters or political elites who share a common understanding of a political challenge and a shared commitment to forging a solution.3 The importance of such a community has been conceptualized within a variety of theoretical frameworks. From one perspective, we can view membership in a community of fate as a form of common knowledge about game structure that facilitates behavioral coordination.4 Alternatively, we can view group-contingent beliefs and behaviors as the direct result of social conditioning or sanctioning.5 In each case, costly individual political behaviors linked to group-contingent benefits may depend on individual perceptions of others' beliefs. In this sense, the establishment of political communities of fate across a range of contemporary political issues may depend not only on first-order personal beliefs, the overarching * Thanks to},

Public policies can shape political participation and attitudes. These effects can be positive or negative, enhancing or undercutting participation and conferring positive or negative messages about individuals' worth as citizens. These effects originate in elements of program design, such as the size, visibility, and traceability of benefits, the proximity of beneficiaries, and modes of program administration.

abstract = {Stream–riparian areas represent a nexus of biodiversity, with disproportionate numbers of species tied to and interacting within this key habitat. New research in Pacific Northwest headwater forests, especially the characterization of microclimates and amphibian distributions, is expanding our perspective of riparian zones, and suggests the need for alternative designs to manage stream–riparian zones and their adjacent uplands. High biodiversity in riparian areas can be attributed to cool moist conditions, high productivity and complex habitat. All 47 northwestern amphibian species have stream–riparian associations, with a third being obligate forms to general stream–riparian areas, and a quarter with life histories reliant on headwater landscapes in particular. Recent recognition that stream-breeding amphibians can disperse hundreds of meters into uplands implies that connectivity among neighboring drainages may be important to their population structures and dynamics. Microclimate studies substantiate a ''stream effect'' of cool moist conditions permeating upslope into warmer, drier forests. We review forest management approaches relative to headwater riparian areas in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, and we propose scenarios designed to retain all habitats used by amphibians with complex life histories. These include a mix of riparian and upslope management approaches to address the breeding, foraging, overwintering, and dispersal functions of these animals. We speculate that the stream microclimate effect can partly counterbalance edge effects imposed by upslope forest disturbances, hence appropriately sized and managed riparian buffers can protect suitable microclimates at streams and within riparian forests. We propose one approach that focuses habitat conservation in headwater areas – where present management allows extensive logging – on sensitive target species, such as tailed frogs and torrent salamanders that often occur patchily. Assuming both high patchiness and some concordance among the distribution of sensitive species, protecting areas with higher abundances of these animals could justify less protection of currently unoccupied or low-density habitats, where more intensive forest management for timber production could occur. Also, we outline an approach that protects juxtaposed headwater patches, retaining connectivity among sub-drainages using a 6th-field watershed spatial scale for assuring well-distributed protected areas across forested landscapes. However, research is needed to test this approach and to determine whether it is sufficient to buffer downstream water quality and habitat from impacts of headwater management. Offering too-sparse protection everywhere is likely insufficient to conserve headwater habitats and biodiversity, while our alternative targeted protection of selected headwaters does not bind the entire forest landscape into a biodiversity reserve. {\#}},

The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vo-cabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than x-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [1]. We derive a mean-field variational inference al-gorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is com-plicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multi-nomial. The CTM gives a better fit than LDA on a collection of OCRed articles from the journal Science.

I acquire the correspondence logs of a dozen bureaucratic agencies through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and re-evaluate the conventional proposition that ideological disagreement drives oversight. Improving on existing research designs, I identify the effect of this disagreement by exploiting the transition from George Bush to Barack Obama, which shifted the ideological orientation of agencies through turnover in agency personnel. Contrary to existing research, I find ideological conflict has a negligible effect on oversight, whereas committee roles and narrow district interests are primary drivers. The findings reveal that absent incentives induced by public auditing, legislator behavior is driven by policy valence concerns-rather than ideology. The results also suggest collective action in Congress may pose greater obstacles to bureaucratic oversight than previously thought.},

The analysis demonstrates that campaigns occur across issue areas under EPA jurisdiction, particularly in the context of complex, economically significant actions. Broad societal constituencies—such as environmentalists—are more active in sponsoring campaigns than specific interests negatively affected by stringent regulations. Industry-led campaigns are regularly divided along sectoral lines, with industries anticipating benefits arguing in favor of stringent regulations and industries forecast to bear the brunt of such actions sponsoring campaigns in opposition to EPA proposals. It is common for campaigns to contain policy-relevant information as a means of bolstering justifications for political sentiments. These findings in some respects confirm and in other respects challenge existing understandings of an increasingly salient form of participation in administrative rulemaking.},

abstract = {Political scientists lack methods to efficiently measure the priorities political actors emphasize in statements. To address this limitation, I introduce a statistical model that attends to the structure of political rhetoric when measuring expressed priorities: statements are naturally organized by author. The expressed agenda model exploits this structure to simultaneously estimate the topics in the texts, as well as the attention political actors allocate to the estimated topics. I apply the method to a collection of over 24,000 press releases from senators from 2007, which I demonstrate is an ideal medium to measure how senators explain their work in Washington to constituents. A set of examples validates the estimated priorities and demonstrates their usefulness for testing theories of how members of Congress communicate with constituents. The statistical model and its extensions will be made available in a forthcoming free software package for the R computing language.},

abstract = {along with the traditional "promissory" form of representation, empirical political scientists have recently analyzed several new forms, called here "anticipatory," "gyroscopic," and "surrogate" representation. None of these more recently recognized forms meets the criteria for democratic accountability developed for promissory representation, yet each generates a set of normative criteria by which it can be judged. These criteria are systemic, in contrast to the dyadic criteria appropriate for promissory representation. They are deliberative rather than aggregative. They are plural rather than singular. ver the past two decades empirical political scientists have developed increasingly sophisti-cated descriptions of how American legislators relate to their constituents. Yet although the empirical work has often been motivated by normative convic-tions that one way of relating is better than another, the normative theory of what constitutes "good" rep-resentation has not kept pace with current empirical findings. This paper seeks to narrow the gap. The traditional model of representation focused on the idea that during campaigns representatives made promises to constituents, which they then kept or failed to keep. I call this promissory representation. In addi-tion, empirical work in the last 20 years has identified at least three other forms of representation, which I call "anticipatory," "gyroscopic," and "surrogate" rep-resentation. Anticipatory representation flows directly from the idea of retrospective voting: Representatives focus on what they think their constituents will approve at the next election, not on what they promised to do at the last election. In gyroscopic representation, the representative looks within, as a basis for action, to conceptions of interest, "common sense," and princi-ples derived in part from the representative's own back-ground. Surrogate representation occurs when legisla-tors represent constituents outside their own districts. These are all legitimate forms of representation. None, however, meets the criteria for democratic ac-countability developed for promissory representation. I argue that the appropriate normative criteria for judg-ing these more recently identified forms of represen-tation are systemic, in contrast to the dyadic criteria appropriate for promissory representation. The crite-ria are almost all deliberative rather than aggregative. And, in keeping with the conclusion that there is more than one way to be represented legitimately in a democ-racy, the criteria are plural rather than singular. The forms of representation identified here do not map well onto the traditional dichotomy of "mandate" and "trustee." Both mandate and trustee forms can appear as versions of promissory representation (or, alternatively, the trustee concept can figure as a subset of gyroscopic representation), but the new concepts of representation implied by recent empirical work do not have an obvious relation to the earlier dichotomy. In practice, representative behavior will often mix several of these forms. One cannot always tell by look-ing at a specific behavior what dynamics lie behind it. Yet analyzing each form separately makes it possible to identify the underlying power relation in each form, the role of deliberation in each, and the normative cri-teria appropriate to each. These normative criteria are goals toward which to strive ("regulative ideals"), not standards that can be fully met. Conceiving of demo-cratic legitimacy as a spectrum and not a dichotomy, one might say that the closer a system of representation comes to meeting the normative criteria for democratic aggregation and deliberation, the more that system is normatively legitimate. Addressing the norms appropriate to a system of representation assumes that representation is, and is normatively intended to be, something more than a de-fective substitute for direct democracy.1 Constituents choose representatives not only to think more care-fully than they about ends and means but also to nego-tiate more perceptively and fight more skillfully than constituents have either the time or the inclination to do. The difference between representation and direct democracy creates a need for norms designed partic-ularly for democratic representation. Yet democratic representation comes in different forms, with norms appropriate to each.},

Several analyses have been made of FSC forest certification in Mexico, but none have summarized the new MFCS system or compared its standards with FSC. We compare the implementation of the non-state FSC market forest certification with the state-sponsored MFCS system in Mexico, and review literature on forest certification, focusing on all studies in Mexico. MFCS has had substantial enrollment of more than 902,802 ha by 2016, compared to 900,388 ha for the more-established FSC program. MFCS can be acceptable for stand-alone forest certification, and might be viewed as a stepwise path to FSC certification. The merits of both systems are analyzed in terms of standard content, likely sustainable forestry practices, access to markets, and community forestry enterprises.},

abstract = {A GOVERNMENT without bureau-crats is like a centipede without legs, unable to move-even to save it-self-and powerless to accomplish any of the goals for which governments are instituted among men. For it is upon the bureaucrats that we depend to see that these goals-or policies-are real-ized in practice. Without administra-tive officers-that is, without a bureauc-racy to carry them into effect-the most fine-spun schemes for promoting the common defense, insuring domestic tranquillity, promoting the general wel-fare, and preserving the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity would be stillborn. Yet there is a widely current notion that bureaucracy and democracy are somehow incompatible-that the bu-reaucrat and the democrat must forever be at odds. This popular antithesis be-tween bureaucracy and democracy is, as Professor Friedrich says, {\&}dquo;an oratori-cal slogan which endangers the future of democracy. For a constitutional system which cannot function effec-tively, which cannot act with dispatch and strength, cannot live.{\&}dquo; 1 Nevertheless, the fears expressed by the demagogues pose problems which cannot be denied for those who want government to be both effective and democratic. Not the least of these is the problem of enforcing responsibility upon the bureaucracy. For among the so-called immutable principles of demo-cratic theory is the assumption that power and responsibility must go hand in hand. Power without responsibility is the very definition of tyranny, and the transition from arbitrary to re-sponsible government involves more than popular control of the legislature, the so-called policy-making branch of the government. It involves also popu-lar control of the executive establish-ment and the bureaucracy through which public policies are translated from law into life. As the functions of the state expand and the size and complexity of the bu-reaucracy increase, the search for ways and means to make these minions of Leviathan more responsible becomes both more important and more intense. But if bureaucratic accountability is to be real and equitable, the bureaucrat must know for what and to whom he is responsible. The Hoover Commission says: The President, and under him his chief lieutenants, the department heads, must be held responsible and accountable to the people and the Congress for the conduct of the executive branch. [But] responsi-bility and accountability are impossible without authority-the power to direct. The exercise of authority is impossible without a clear line of command from the top to the bottom, and a return line of re-sponsibility and accountability from the bottom to the top. IMPLICATIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY But {\&}dquo;responsibility{\&}dquo; implies more than mere accountability for what is or is not done, and more too than a strict adherence to policy mandates as they come from the legislature and/or one's administrative superiors and associates. It implies also a high level of technical competence for the job one is called upon to do, a personal character that is loyal, honest, and reliable, a dedication to duty, and faith in the basic values 1 Carl J.

abstract = {Corporate codes of conduct, product certifications, process standards, and other voluntary, non-governmental forms of private governance have proliferated in the last two decades. These innovations are a response to social pressures unleashed by globalization and the inadequacy of governmental institutions for addressing its social and environmental impacts. Private governance has had some notable successes, but there are clear limits to what it alone can be expected to accomplish. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of private governance depends on four main factors: 1) the structure of the particular global value chain in which production takes place; 2) the extent to which demand for a firm's products relies on its brand identity; 3) the possibilities for collective action by consumers, workers, or other activists to exert pressure on producers; and 4) the extent to which commercial interests of lead firms align with social and environmental concerns. Taken together, these hypotheses suggest that private governance will flourish in only a limited set of circumstances. With the trend towards consolidation of production in the largest developing countries, however, we also see a strengthening of some forms of public governance. Private governance will not disappear, but it will be linked to emerging forms of multi-stakeholder institutions.},

This paper estimates by a du-ration model the in uence of school absenteeism on the risk of dropout in secondary education. In particular, using a semiparametric Cox duration model, the timing of the dropout decision of truants is compared with the timing of regular school attendees. Using administrative data with insights on wrongly speci{\ldots}cied truancy spells, we correct in a Baysian duration model for issues on data uncertainty. We show that only a Baysian structure on the data yields insightful and consistent results. The analyis provides evi-dence of poor data validity on post-compulsory secondary school students aged 18 years old or older. Moreover, the results indicate that school-aged students enrolled in voca-tional education are most vulnarable to unauthorized school absenteeism and dropout.

abstract = {Universities require faculty and students planning research involving human subjects to pass formal certification tests and then submit research plans for prior approval. Those who diligently take the tests may better understand certain important legal requirements but, at the same time, are often misled into thinking they can apply these rules to their own work which, in fact, they are not permitted to do. They will also be missing many other legal requirements not mentioned in their training but which govern their behaviors. Finally, the training leaves them likely to completely misunderstand the essentially political situation they find themselves in. The resulting risks to their universities, collaborators, and careers may be catastrophic, in addition to contributing to the more common ordinary frustrations of researchers with the system. To avoid these problems, faculty and students conducting research about and for the public need to understand that they are public figures, to whom different rules apply, ones that political scientists have long studied. University administrators (and faculty in their part time roles as administrators) need to reorient their perspectives as well. University research compliance bureaucracies have grown, in well meaning but sometimes unproductive ways that are not required by federal laws or guidelines. We offer advice to faculty and students for how to deal with the system as it exists now, and suggestions for changes in university research compliance bureaucracies, that should benefit faculty, students, staff, university budgets, and our research subjects.},

Often, the politics of client benefits is only exacerbated once the policy implementation phase begins.

We find that an increase in the proportion of committee members voting for drug approval increases the probability of FDA approval and that an increase in the proportion of committee members voting for approval reduces the time it takes for the FDA to approve a drug or device application after committee consultation. Additionally, for theoretical and empirical reasons, our analysis explores the FDA's decision to consult advisory committees and its concern about the delay that committee consultation might introduce.

abstract = {Does external monitoring improve democratic performance? Fact-checking has come to play an increasingly important role in political coverage in the United States, but some research suggests it may be ineffective at reducing public misperceptions about controversial issues. However, fact-checking might instead help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. To evaluate this deterrent hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment on a diverse group of state legislators from nine U.S. states in the months before the November 2012 election. In the experiment, a randomly assigned subset of state legislators was sent a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat. T o what extent can external monitoring increase political accountability and improve democratic outcomes? Social scientists are increasingly using field experiments to understand the ways in which monitoring can shape political and bureaucratic behavior (e.g., Butler 2010; Duflo, Hanna, and Rya 2012; Ferraz and Finan 2008; Grose n.d.; Humphreys and Weinstein n.d.; Malesky, Schuler, and Tran 2012; Olken 2007). One important source of external monitoring for politicians in free societies is the press. In the United States, several fact-checking organizations have begun to systematically evaluate the accuracy of statements made by politicians at the national and state level using a journalistic approach (Graves and Glaisyer 2012), but little systematic evidence exists on the consequences of this practice. Among the mass public, the evidence is mixed on whether fact-checking improves citizens' political knowledge. Some studies suggest that it can be effective. For instance, Pingree, Brossard, and McLeod (2014) show that journalistic adjudication of factual disputes Brendan Nyhan is Assistant Professor,},

abstract = {A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining which topics that document addresses. We describe a generative model for documents, introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. {\&} Jordan, M. I. (2003) J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations pro-vided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applica-tions of this analysis, including identifying ''hot topics'' by exam-ining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content. W hen scientists decide to write a paper, one of the first things they do is identify an interesting subset of the many possible topics of scientific investigation. The topics addressed by a paper are also one of the first pieces of information a person tries to extract when reading a scientific abstract. Scientific experts know which topics are pursued in their field, and this information plays a role in their assessments of whether papers are relevant to their interests, which research areas are rising or falling in popularity, and how papers relate to one another. Here, we present a statistical method for automatically extracting a representation of documents that provides a first-order approx-imation to the kind of knowledge available to domain experts. Our method discovers a set of topics expressed by documents, providing quantitative measures that can be used to identify the content of those documents, track changes in content over time, and express the similarity between documents. We use our method to discover the topics covered by papers in PNAS in a purely unsupervised fashion and illustrate how these topics can be used to gain insight into some of the structure of science. The statistical model we use in our analysis is a generative model for documents; it reduces the complex process of pro-ducing a scientific paper to a small number of simple probabi-listic steps and thus specifies a probability distribution over all possible documents. Generative models can be used to postulate complex latent structures responsible for a set of observations, making it possible to use statistical inference to recover this structure. This kind of approach is particularly useful with text, where the observed data (the words) are explicitly intended to communicate a latent structure (their meaning). The particular generative model we use, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation, was introduced in ref. 1. This generative model postulates a latent structure consisting of a set of topics; each document is produced by choosing a distribution over topics, and then generating each word at random from a topic chosen by using this distribution. The plan of this article is as follows. In the next section, we describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation and present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model, illustrating the operation of our algorithm on a small dataset. We then apply our algorithm to a corpus consisting of abstracts from PNAS from 1991 to 2001, determining the number of topics needed to account for the information contained in this corpus and ex-tracting a set of topics. We use these topics to illustrate the relationships between different scientific disciplines, assessing trends and ''hot topics'' by analyzing topic dynamics and using the assignments of words to topics to highlight the semantic content of documents.},

Our model uses these seeds to improve both topic-word distributions (by biasing topics to pro-duce appropriate seed words) and to im-prove document-topic distributions (by bi-asing documents to select topics related to the seed words they contain). Extrinsic evaluation on a document clustering task reveals a significant improvement when us-ing seed information, even over other mod-els that use seed information navely.},

The electoral connection causes marginal representatives—legislators with districts composed of the other party's partisans—to emphasize appropriations in their home styles. But it causes aligned representatives—those with districts filled with copartisans—to build their home styles around position taking. Aggregated across representatives, this results in an artificial polarization in stated party positions: aligned representatives, who tend to be ideologically extreme, dominate policy debates. The logic and evidence in this article provide an explanation for the apparent rise in vitriolic debate, and the new measures facilitate a literature on home styles.},

abstract = {Young, and in particular Dustin Tingley, for useful discussions, and the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable input. Abstract Statistical models of text have become increasingly popular in statistics and com-puter science as a method of exploring large document collections. Social scientists often want to move beyond exploration, to measurement and experimentation, and make inference about social and political processes that drive discourse and content. In this paper, we develop a model of text data that supports this type of substantive research. Our approach is to posit a hierarchical mixed membership model for an-alyzing topical content of documents, in which mixing weights are parameterized by observed covariates. In this model, topical prevalence and topical content are spec-ified as a simple generalized linear model on an arbitrary number of document-level covariates, such as news source and time of release, enabling researchers to introduce elements of the experimental design that informed document collection into the model, within a generally applicable framework. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by analyzing a collection of news reports about China, where we allow the prevalence of topics to evolve over time and vary across newswire services. Our methods quantify the effect of news wire source on both the frequency and nature of topic coverage.},

Researchers seek to study not only whether one variable affects another but also how such a causal relationship arises. Yet commonly used statistical methods for identifying causal mechanisms rely upon untestable assumptions and are often inappropriate even under those assumptions. Randomizing treatment and intermediate variables is also insufficient. Despite these difficulties, the study of causal mechanisms is too important to abandon. We make three contributions to improve research on causal mechanisms. First, we present a minimum set of assumptions required under standard designs of experimental and observational studies and develop a general algorithm for estimating causal mediation effects. Second, we provide a method for assessing the sensitivity of conclusions to potential violations of a key assumption. Third, we offer alternative research designs for identifying causal mechanisms under weaker assumptions.

abstract = {Recent advances in computational content analysis have provided scholars promising new ways for estimating party positions. However, existing text-based methods face challenges in producing valid and reliable time-series data. This article proposes a scaling algorithm called WORDFISH to estimate policy positions based on word frequencies in texts. The technique allows researchers to locate parties in one or multiple elections. We demonstrate the algorithm by estimating the positions of German political parties from 1990 to 2005 using word frequencies in party manifestos. The extracted positions reflect changes in the party system more accurately than existing time-series estimates. In addition, the method allows researchers to examine which words are important for placing parties on the left and on the right. We find that words with strong political connotations are the best discriminators between parties. Finally, a series of robustness checks demonstrate that the estimated positions are insensitive to distributional assumptions and document selection. M any theories of comparative politics rely on the ability of researchers to locate political parties in a policy space. Theories of coalition forma-tion and duration use party positions to predict which governments form and how long they survive (Baron 1991; Crombez 1996; de Swaan 1973; Druckman and Thies 2002; Druckman, Martin, and Thies 2005; Strom 1984; Warwick 1992). Likewise, theories of lawmaking use distances between parties to predict policy change (Bawn 1999; Hallerberg and Basinger 1998; Tsebelis 2002), as do analyses of budgetary politics (Franzese 2002), globaliza-tion and the social welfare state (Garrett 1998), and labor politics (Wallerstein 1999). In fact, all tests of spatial mod-els in comparative politics rely on the ability to estimate party positions. Despite the importance of party positions to the study of comparative politics, locating parties in a po-litical space over time is a difficult task. Although one might have a good intuition about where parties stand relative to each other, the positions themselves are ab-stract concepts that cannot be observed directly (Benoit and Laver 2006b, chap. 3).

abstract = {With the emergence of the Arab Spring and the Occupy movements, interest in the study of movements that use the Internet and social networking sites has grown exponentially. However, our inability to easily and cheaply analyze the large amount of content these move-ments produce limits our study of them. This article attempts to address this methodological lacuna by detailing procedures for collecting data from Facebook and presenting a class of computer-aided content analysis methods. I apply one of these methods in the analysis of mobilization patterns of Egypt's April 6 youth movement. I corroborate the method with in-depth interviews from movement participants. I conclude by discussing the difficulties and pitfalls of using this type of data in content analysis and in using automated methods for coding textual data in multiple languages. Contemporary movements almost invariably incorporate online tools into their tactical repertoires. Although high-profile cases such as the 2011 Egyptian revolution and Occupy Wall Street have garnered the most attention, some of the fundamental work of movement activists—coordination, persuasion, and discussion—has been facilitated by the integration of social media and other information and communication technologies (ICTs). Accordingly, movement scholars are turning their focus to ICTs to better understand what is happening in these spaces and to incorporate them into the existing social movement literature. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter provide us with the ability to observe what an activist or a would-be activist is saying and doing as an instance of contention unfolds. Their profile characteristics display relevant information about them, their utterances suggest partic-ular courses of action, and the connections they make with others highlight the networked nature of these sites. At the same time, the data available to researchers studying these movements have far surpassed the amount that had been previously available for analysis. The sheer scale of these data could give us unprecedented leverage in answering questions about social movement activity. While many studies of mobilization with ICTs have been studied in terms of network structure and message volume, most have neglected to focus on the content of messages at scale. These data can be better leveraged with computer-aided content analysis methods that can classify message content. {\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}},

At the time, it was the first major study to examine the role of interest groups in one of the most important policy-making venues in our democratic system. This article reexamines interest group participation in rule making a decade later. We focus most of the study on comparisons in how organizations access rule-making agencies, what techniques are used to lobby agencies, and the perceived effectiveness of these techniques by the organizations themselves. In addition, given the relatively new phenomenon of e-rule making and the increase of other electronic communication techniques, we open an examination of interest groups use of these forms of communications and their implications. We find that rule making continues to be a primary concern of organizations trying to influence federal public policy, even as they have focused more on campaign and grassroots activities.

We show that emigration has moved beyond its historical origins in west-central Mexico into the central region and, to a lesser extent, the southeast and border regions. In the United States, traditional gateways continue to dominate, but a variety of new destinations have emerged. California, in particular, has lost its over-whelming dominance.

Yet, measuring discretion in order to test various theories of delegation is challenging. The few existing measures have difficulty capturing both delegations and constraints in a consistent way over time. In this paper, we seek to overcome these challenges by offering a novel measure of executive discretion based on legislative appropriations to all agencies, weighted by the spending limitations imposed on these agencies found within appropriations committee reports. We first validate this measure by using it to test the " ally principle, " finding that Congress gives greater discretion to agencies when ideologically aligned with the president. Further, we use our new measure to test additional discretion-based theories related to military combat, the " Two Presidencies, " and agency insulation. Overall, this measure can be used to evaluate other previously difficult to test theories of policymaking.},

abstract = {The path of environmental law has come to a cliff called climate change, and there is no turning around. As climate change policy dialogue emerged in the 1990s, however, the perceived urgency of attention to mitigation strategies designed to regulate sources of greenhouse gas emissions quickly snuffed out meaningful progress on the formulation of adaptation strategies designed to respond to the effects of climate change on humans and the environment. Only recently has this " adaptation deficit " become a concern now actively included in climate change policy debate. Previously treating talk of adaptation as taboo, the climate change policy world has begrudgingly accepted it into the fold as the reality of failed efforts to achieve global mitigation policy has combined with the scientific evidence that committed Yarqon. The FSU College of Law provided support for my research assistants, Jake Cremer and Andrew Hoek, and for my work on the Article in general. All errors and omissions are, of course, my own doing. Please direct questions and comments to jruhl@law.fsu.edu. GAL.RUHL.DOC 6/23/2010 2:49 PM 364 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 40:363 warming will continue the trend of climate change well into the future regardless of mitigation policy success. But do not expect adaptation policy to play out for environmental law the way mitigation policy has and is likely to continue. Mitigation policy has been framed as an initiative primarily within the domain of environmental law—a form of pollution control on steroids—and thus it will be environmental law that makes the first move and other policy realms that apply support or pushback. By contrast, environmental law does not " own " adaptation policy; rather, numerous policy fronts will compete simultaneously for primacy and priority as people demand protection from harms and enjoyment of benefits that play out as climate change moves relentlessly forward. This makes it all the more pressing for environmental law, early in the nation's formulation of adaptation policy, to find its voice and establish its place in the effort to close the adaptation deficit. Toward that purpose, this Article examines the context and policy dynamics of climate change adaptation and identifies ten trends that will have profound normative and structural impacts on how environmental law fits in: 1) shift in emphasis from preservationism to transitionalism in natural resources conservation policy, 2) rapid evolution of property rights and liability rules associated with natural capital adaptation resources, 3) accelerated merger of water law, land-use law, and environmental law, 4) incorporation of a human rights dimension in climate change adaptation policy, 5) catastrophe and crisis avoidance and response as an overarching adaptation policy priority, 6) frequent reconfigurations of transpolicy linkages and trade-offs at all scales and across scales, 7) shift from " front end " decision methods relying on robust predictive capacity to " back end " decision methods relying on active adaptive management, 8) greater variety and flexibility in regulatory instruments, 9) increased reliance on multiscalar governance networks, and 10) conciliation.},

To facilitate this effort, we advance hypotheses from a foundational theory of lawmaking effectiveness that arises from members' innate abilities, cultivated skills, and institutional positioning. We develop a method for cardinally ranking members of the U.S. House of Representatives in terms of their effectiveness at moving bills through the legislative process, and we apply this method to generate a Legislative Effectiveness Score (LES) for each House member in each of the 97th-109th Congresses. We demonstrate that our measure is consistent with our theoretical hypotheses, and that it is relevant to the examination of numerous prior theories of legislative politics. We suggest a number of theoretical and empirical venues that could be enhanced by a greater focus on legislative effectiveness in Congress. *},

For firms, the value of joining a green club over taking the same actions unilaterally is to appropriate the club's positive brand reputation. Our analysis of about 3,700U.S. facilities indicates that joining ISO 14001, an important nongovernmental voluntary program, improves facilities' compliance with govern- ment regulations. We conjecture that ISO 14001 is effective because its broad positive standing with external audiences provides a reputational benefit that helps induce facilities to take costly progressive environmental action they would not take unilaterally.},

We argue that mainstream re- search in this subfield—framed by images of representative democracy and Marshallian citizenship—has provided a rich portrait of what such commu- nities lack in political life. Indeed, by focusing so effectively on their political marginalization, political scientists have ironically made such communities marginal to the subfield's account of American democracy and citizenship. In this article, we provide a corrective by focusing on what is present in the political lives of such communities. To redress the current imbalance and advance the understandings of race and class in American politics, we ar- gue that studies of the liberal-democratic “first face” of the state must be complemented by greater attention to the state's more controlling “second face.” Focusing on policing, we seek to unsettle the mainstream of a subfield that rarely inquires into governmental practices of social control and the ways “race-class subjugated communities” are governed through coercion, containment, repression, surveillance, regulation, predation, discipline, and violence},

{\textperiodcentered}Court makes policy on margin, mostly confers legitimacy on ruling coalition, and, “at its best, upon the basic patterns of behavior required for the operation of a democracy” 
o Legal criteria are inadequate - Uncertain about consequences and preferences – must choose among controversial alternatives 
o If thought to be “political” no problem, but legitimacy rests on the fiction that it is not a political institution (IN THE FIGHTING MEANING OF POLITICAL, BUT IN THE POLICYMAKING MEANING?)

{\S}majority – decision must favor a majority or minority over another – America is minorities rule country, bargaining, results in policy 
{\'{u}} striking a statute could be thought to be overruling a majority 
01. this would be to deny popular soveignty in America (100{\%} POP SOV, YES, THE WILL IS NEVER PERFECTLY CONSTITUTED AND REQUIRES JUDEMENT OF POLICYMAKERS + OLIGARCIC JUDGEMENT OF RIGHT---THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL TENSION) 
02. except for new deal, courts generally overturn old legislation{\ldots}.meaning that they are responsive to ?legislative? Majorities? - Worst battle with legislator was over child labor laws, which the court blocked from 1916 to 1941 ={\textgreater}“lawmaking majorities gengerally have their way” - 29 
{\S}3 – Rights/Justice 
{\'{u}} norms of justice will generally be the same as other political elite 
{\'{u}} finds it implausible that court finds natural rights to employ child labor, be free from taxes and workmans comp{\ldots}.SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING? WAS IT NOT JUSTIFIED ON THE BASES OF THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT? 
{\'{u}} Court has upheld rights of privileged against rights of submerged groups – slaves and people of color WHAT ABOUT DOMA? 
o CONCLUSION: National politics in democracies is marked by coalitions that are stable over time- marked by break with past, struggle, consolidation, and decay 
{\S}Court is part of major coalition and powerless to affect the course of national policy 
{\S}It is an essential part of the coalition – unique legitimacy

Conventionally labeled as ‘self- governance' because they are organized around global product chains, the programs also incorporate a growing variety of non-economic interests from around the world in policy making and implementation and often compete with each other within economic sectors. The paper focuses on forestry, but also discusses organic agriculture, apparel, and fisheries certification, describing the structure and dynamics of these programs as well as their relationships to state legal regimes. It suggests, among other things, that the programs should be understood as a kind of law making that interacts in intricate ways with state based legal systems, that they have had surprisingly large effects on operational practices, that they may be evolving distinctive new accountability systems, and that they rely particularly heavily on ‘logics of appropriateness' in seeking to establish their legitimacy.

We consider how such interactions affect policy implementation and representation. We argue that legislators try to influence bureaucratic decisions through direct communication with federal agencies, and that such contact is effective and has consequences for policy outcomes. We provide empirical evidence of this argument using original data about direct communication between members of Congress and the US Department of Labor (DOL) along with decisions made by the DOL regarding trade and redistributive policies. We find that direct contacts influence DOL decisions, and the agency is more likely to reverse previous decisions when requested to do so by legislators.

The processes of migration have always challenged the taken-for-granted assumption that physical proximity is necessary for the maintenance of significant social ties. Now, more than ever before, the proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and new media environments has begun to challenge the premise that strong relationships require face-to-face inter-actions. Even more than affordable travel, it is the expansion and enhancement of technologies of communication such as the internet, smartphones and social media that have contributed to the recent, startling emergence of a new social environment of ubiquitous connectivity. This new social reality transforms sociality in (post)modern societies in complex ways. To reflect these transformations, a new lexicon has begun to develop that charts the social impacts of new applications of such technologies. The important work of Castells (1996) on the 'network society' points to the ways in which communication},

First, we agree that for a political system to be viable, for it to succeed in per- forming tasks of authoritative resource allo- cation, problem solving, conflict settlement, and so on, in behalf of a population of any substantial size, it must be institutionalized. That is to say, organizations must be created and sustained that are specialized to political activity.' Otherwise, the political system is likely to be unstable, weak, and incapable of servicing the demands or protecting the in- terests of its constituent groups. Secondly, it is generally agreed that for a political system to be in some sense free and democratic, means must be found for institutionalizing representa- tiveness with all the diversity that this implies, and for legitimizing yet at the same time con- taining political opposition within the system.2},

Key examines Massachusetts and New England election returns for the election of Al Smith in 1928, the first Catholic presidential nominee. He notes that this election was the flashpoint for a wide and new cleavage, examining the more immigrant-centered Somerville with the more rural Ashfield. He then replicates these results in the rest of the state and in the remaining New England states aggregating the towns or districts with the biggest Democratic gains against those with the smallest. What he finds is that these new coalitions began at a certain point and remained durable over his period of analysis, 1916 to 1952. He analyzes and finds similar results analyzing the data from Massachusetts by the size of the town, showing a sharp loss by the democratic party in all size towns between 1892 and 1896, and a gain of increasing magnitude by population for the Democrats between 1920 and 1928. He concludes by noting: The actual election rarely presents in pure form a case fitting completely any particular concept. Especially in a large and diverse electorate a single polling may encompass radically varying types of behavior among different categories of voters; yet a dominant characteristic often makes itself apparent.},

Two legal norms also exert substantive effects as the Court is less likely to overrule statutory precedents and more likely to overrule precedents that previously have been interpreted negatively by the Court. While certain precedent characteristics also influence this decision, the political environ- ment exerts no such effect. Consequently, one of the principal implications of this research is that legal norms influence Supreme Court decision making.},

on senators' policy contact with the bureaucracy during the 110th and the 111th Congresses and
draw on original bureaucratic records from the U.S. Departments of Labor and Homeland
Security, reveal that a senator's institutional position, constraints, and behavior within the
legislative process predict her engagement in backchannel policymaking. These findings
illustrate how members of Congress try to influence policy outside of the formal lawmaking

@book{Wilson1989,
abstract = {Wilson examines bureaucratic efficiency and capacity, and attempts to explain the agendas bureaucracies set out to realize and the constraints that hamper their ability to execute effectively. He outlines three primary constraints (Chapter 7) on bur eaucratic behavior: (1) they lack a profit maximizing incentive, since they are legally precluded from distributing profits to their clients; (2) they are unable to dynamically allocate resources to areas of greatest need or even greatest success; and fina lly (3) bureaucratic agencies serve goals that are not of their own choosing. Importantly, many of these constraints are not the result of internal failure but are imposed from external actors like Congress. This “red tape” is motivated by a desire to prevent agency misbehavior. Wilson concludes that these constraints lead to overly complex procedures and institutional rules, an incentive structure that aligns more closely with minimizing constraint violation than effective outcomes, and a proliferation of middle management who are incentivized to be risk averse and shy from innovation. As such, the inefficiency many experience in their interactions with bureaucracy isn't necessarily a result of agencies eager to assume an ever-increasing number of functions ; rather it is often their need to adhere to specific policy prescriptions that leads to inefficiency. Bureaucracy is the classic study of the way American government agencies work and how they can be made to work better. Examining a wide range of bureaucracies, including the Army, the FBI, the FCC, and the Social Security Administration, James Q. Wilson provides the first comprehensive, in-depth analysis of what government agencies do, why they function as they do, and how they might become more responsible and effective.

However, the role of private authority in the regime complex – situations where non-state actors set rules or standards that other actors adopt – has only recently received academic attention. In this article, we ‘unbundle' the concept of the regime complex in two novel ways. Firstly, we argue that an accurate depiction of any regime complex must also include private authority. Secondly, using examples from environmental governance, we carefully elaborate four specific mechanisms through which public and private authority interact, demonstrating the ways in which private authority can improve the problem-solving capacity of regime complexes. In short, a full understanding of the contributions of private authority to solving environmental problems requires examining its interactions with public rules and institutions.},

abstract = {All matters related to ethnography flow from a decision that originates at the very beginning of the research process—the selection of the basic object of analysis— and yet fieldworkers pay scant attention to this crucial task. As a result, most take as their starting point bounded entities delimited by location or social classification and in so doing restrict the kinds of arguments available to them. This article presents the alternative of relational ethnography. Relational ethnography involves studying fields rather than places, boundaries rather than bounded groups, processes rather than processed people, and cultural conflict rather than group culture. While this approach comes with its own set of challenges, it offers an ethnographic method that works with the relational and processual nature of social reality. Most sociological ethnographies are either of places (e.g., neighborhoods, workplaces) or groups (e.g., single mothers, political activists). This article presents an alternative to group-and place-based fieldwork: relational ethnography. Relational ethnography takes as its scientific object neither a bounded group defined by members' shared social attributes nor a location delimited by the boundaries of a particular neighborhood or the walls of an organization but rather processes involving configurations of relations among different actors or institutions. Since the earliest days of the Chicago School (e.g., Zorbaugh 1929), ethnographers have shown that we cannot hope to understand the dynamics of the social world by comprehending delimited groups as individual cases with semi-autonomous histories and lifestyles. Anthropology, too, has a longstanding interest in studying social rela-tions, going back to the Manchester School (e.g., Mitchell 1956), and has witnessed an efflorescence of relational approaches to fieldwork (Appadurai 1990; Marcus 1998). I am not the first to have discussed nor to have conducted relational ethnography.},

abstract = {Abstract Eco-labeling schemes now exist in nearly every country on Earth and are gaining traction with some of the world's largest companies. However the rigour and credibility of these schemes varies widely. Whereas some eco-labeling organizations (ELOs) adhere to best practices designed to increase the likelihood that their schemes will be rigorous and credible, others do not. In this dissertation, I explain variation in the level of adherence to best practices amongst transnational eco-labeling organizations using a two-phased mixed-method research design. In the first phase, I build and analyze an original dataset comprising information on the policies and practices of 123 transnational ELOs. In the second phase, I build on my statistical findings by further investigating both deductive and abductive hypotheses in the context of two representative case studies, sustainable aquaculture and carbon labeling. My central argument is that who an eco-labeling organization targets for governance holds a strong relationship to its propensity to follow best practices. Specifically, ELOs that “aim big” – meaning those that target a large proportion of a relevant global market – are more likely to follow best practices than those with narrower ambitions. “Aiming big” subjects ELOs to heightened critical scrutiny, increases demand for democratic legitimacy, and over time, augments their organizational capacity. These three conditions, in turn, drive attention to best iii practices and help create rigorous and credible eco-labels with a better chance of meeting environmental objectives. This dissertation contributes in several ways to scholarship on private authority and global governance. First, it suggests that renewed scholarly attention be directed towards the targets of governance, since pressure towards procedural rigour often comes from the governed community and not the owners of a governance scheme. Second, it argues that there is no unitary pathway to rigorous and credible governance; different causal mechanisms and multiple behavioral logics are operative in steering ELOs towards increased best practice adherence. Lastly, it holds implications for policy by suggesting that ELOs should purposively seek global presence and target large businesses when seeking to maximize their environmental impacts.},

abstract = {This is a book about Natural Language Processing. By “natural language” we mean a
language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages such as English,
Hindi, or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as programming languages
and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from
generation to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take
Natural Language Processing—or NLP for short—in a wide sense to cover any kind of
computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as
counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme,
NLP involves “understanding” complete human utterances, at least to the extent of
being able to give useful responses to them.
Technologies based on NLP are becoming increasingly widespread. For example,
phones and handheld computers support predictive text and handwriting recognition;
web search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured text; machine
translation allows us to retrieve texts written in Chinese and read them in Spanish. By
providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more sophisticated access to
stored information, language processing has come to play a central role in the multilingual
information society.
This book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of NLP. It can be used
for individual study or as the textbook for a course on natural language processing or
computational linguistics, or as a supplement to courses in artificial intelligence, text
mining, or corpus linguistics. The book is intensely practical, containing hundreds of
fully worked examples and graded exercises.
The book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source
library called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). NLTK includes extensive software,
data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from http://www.nltk.org/.
Distributions are provided for Windows, Macintosh, and Unix platforms. We strongly
encourage you to download Python and NLTK, and try out the examples and exercises

abstract = {Congressional enactments and executive orders instruct agencies to
publish their anticipated rules in what is known as the Unified Agenda. The
Agenda's stated purpose is to ensure that political actors can monitor
regulatory development. Agencies have come under fire in recent years,
however, for conspicuous omissions and irregularities. Critics allege that
agencies hide their regulations from the public strategically, that is, to
thwart potential political opposition. Others contend that such behavior is
benign, perhaps the inevitable result of changing internal priorities or
unforeseen events.
To examine these competing hypotheses, this Article uses a new
dataset spanning over thirty years of rulemaking (1983–2014). Uniquely,
the dataset is drawn directly from the Federal Register. The resulting
findings reveal that agencies substantially underreport their rulemaking
activities—about 70 percent of their proposed rules do not appear on the Unified Agenda before publication. Importantly, agencies also appear to
disclose strategically with respect to Congress, though not with respect to
the president. The Unified Agenda is thus not a successful tool for
Congress to monitor and influence regulatory development. The results
suggest that legislative, not executive, innovations may help to augment
public participation and democratic oversight, though the net effects of
more transparency remain uncertain. The findings also raise further
inquiries, such as why Congress does not render disclosure requirements

abstract = {A great deal of skepticism toward administrative agencies stems from the widespread perception that they
excessively or even exclusively cater to business interests. From the political right comes the accusation that
business interests use regulation to erect barriers to entry that protect profits and stifle competition. From the
political left comes the claim that business interests use secretive interactions with agencies to erode and negate
beneficial regulatory programs. Regulatory “capture” theory elevates many of these claims to the status of
economic law. Despite growing skepticism about capture theory in academic circles, empirical studies of business
influence and capture return ambiguous results, and they have failed to analyze fully the critical agenda-setting
stage of the regulatory process (where business influence is likely to be especially pronounced), leaving capture
theory standing as a plausible description of regulatory policymaking.
In this Article, I take a close look at business influence in the agenda-setting stage of the rulemaking process.
Using original data on all the rulemaking petitions submitted to three administrative agencies from 2000 to
2016, I trace how, when, and why agencies respond, giving attention to the agencies' responsiveness to the type
of petitioner and the character of the requests. Although business interests may participate at a higher rate than
public interest groups and individuals, analysis of the factors that drive agency decision making about which
petitions to accept suggests a distinct lack of any business advantage. Even in a venue where it would be
exceedingly easy to give business interests precisely what they want, agencies remain largely unmoved and evenhanded.
The pattern that does emerge—an agency preference for using petitions to inform incremental revision
of existing regulations to reflect changed circumstances or new technologies—probably does inure mostly to the
benefit of regulated entities, but it is difficult to square with theories of excessive influence or capture of the
regulatory process by business interests. These findings strongly suggest that agencies are able to maintain critical
distance from business in making important decisions about the scope of the regulatory agenda and, by extension,
the content of regulatory law.},

abstract = {Auer deference holds that when agencies interpret their own pre-existing regulations, they receive
deference from reviewing courts. The doctrine serves a critical function in the administrative process, obviating
the need for agencies to undergo costly notice-and-comment rulemaking each time interpretation of existing
regulations is necessary and guaranteeing that agencies' good faith exercise of interpretive discretion will be
respected by courts. But for some leading scholars and jurists, this benign-sounding doctrine actually encourages
agencies to promulgate vague rules in the first instance, augmenting agency power and violating core separationof-powers
norms in the process. This “perverse incentives thesis” has become increasingly influential, but it has
never been tested.
In this article, I scrutinize the perverse incentives thesis from both an empirical and a theoretical
standpoint. I first test the thesis empirically using an original and extensive dataset of federal rules from 1982-
2016. My analysis reveals that agencies did not measurably increase the vagueness of their writing in response
to Auer. If anything, rule writing arguably became more specific over time despite Auer's increasing prominence.
Seeking answers to why there is such a disconnect between theory and reality, I turn inward to the agencies
themselves, contrasting the simple model of comprehensive rationality offered by Auer's critics with a more
realistic institutional account of agency officials as boundedly rational “satisficers.” In particular, I show that
in the choice about whether to offer specificity now or later, agencies are driven by both their inner cognitive
infrastructure and core administrative law (e.g., hard look review) to front-load specificity.
These findings not only caution against taking the fast-moving assault on Auer too far, but also draw
attention to the need to test behavioral theories of administrative law against the empirical record. Because the
administrative state often relaxes formalistic prescriptions that each of the powers of government be hermetically
sealed, it is easy to derive predictions about perverse incentives that result from the combination of powers. But
deriving a model from first principles does not prove a claim, and I argue that core administrative law doctrine
should not be changed on the basis of unsubstantiated theories about its behavioral effects},

decisions of federal agencies. There exists a robust literature on mechanisms of distributive
influence, exercised by both members of congress and the president; each is motivated to secure
forms of particularistic spending to gain an electoral advantage. But recent research indicates that
the ban on Congressional earmarks has resulted in federal agencies having more control over the
allocation of distributive benefits (Mills et al 2015). How has the ban on legislative earmarks
shifted the balance of competing influences over the distributive landscape? Using data on
federal spending from the Federal Assistance Awards Data System (FAADS), I assess the impact
of the earmark ban by examining the relationship between indicators of congressional and
executive influence and distributive spending. My findings suggest the ban on congressional
earmarks weakens some means of party-centric congressional influence, particularly the
distributive advantage enjoyed by the majority, while leaving those of the president unaffected. I
also find no relationship between an agency's level of independence and distributive outcomes as
a result of the ban on earmarks.},

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but it has been difficult to determine whether certain
groups are more influential on outcomes. This debate persists because the literature illustrates
that groups can be influential at discrete stages in the process, but the field rarely analyzes the
entire rulemaking process. This uncertainty has spurred controversy regarding the EPA's recent
climate change regulations. Therefore, this dissertation conducted three case studies of recent
climate change regulations and addresses three questions. First, what, if any, strategies did
interest groups use to influence the content of these climate change rules? Second, did these
strategies translate into influence? Third, what can these climate change case studies tell us about
the role of interest groups in other controversial rules at the EPA, and across the bureaucracy
more broadly? Ultimately, I argue that interest group influence was generally balanced across
each of the three case studies. These findings then serve as the basis to develop my Regulatory
Spheres of Influence Framework. The framework illustrates that given the nature of EPA
rulemakings, it is very difficult for one side either business or environmental to dominate the
process in highly controversial rules. It is possible that these conclusions track to other
controversial rules across the bureaucracy and I note that my framework could be applied in
other contexts to test this assertion.},

abstract = {A small but growing social science literature examines the correspondence between experimental results obtained in lab and field settings. This article reviews this literature and reanalyzes a set of recent experiments carried out in parallel in both the lab and field. Using a standardized format that calls attention to both the experimental estimates and the statistical uncertainty surrounding them, the study analyzes the overall pattern of lab-field correspondence, which is found to be quite strong (Spearman's r 5 0.73). Recognizing that this correlation may be distorted by the ad hoc manner in which lab-field comparisons are constructed (as well as the selective manner in which results are reported and published), the article concludes by suggesting directions for future research, stressing in particular the need for more systematic investigation of treatment effect heterogeneity. L ab experiments and field experiments offer complementary approaches to the study of cause and effect in the social sciences. Both methods attempt to isolate the causal influence of one or more interventions by eliminating the systematic intrusion of confounding factors. Experiments carried out in lab or field settings typically allocate subjects randomly to treatment and control groups, ensuring that those assigned to each group have the same expected potential outcomes. Apparent differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups therefore reflect either the effect of the treatment or random sampling variability. The interpretation of experimental results, however, depends on the setting in which the study is carried out. Although the line between lab and field is sometimes blurry (Gerber and Green 2012; Harrison and List 2004), lab and field studies typically differ in terms of who the subjects are, the context in which they receive the treatments, the sort of treatments that are administered and the manner in which outcomes are measured. Field experiments tend to assess the effects of a real-world intervention on those who would ordinarily encounter it. Although field experiments frequently use surveys to assess outcomes (cf. Glennerster and Takavarasha 2013), they otherwise tend not to alert subjects to the fact that they are being studied in connection with a particular intervention, and often measure outcomes unobtrusively after the intervention occurs.

Such oversight can increase the quality of agency regulation, but it also introduces inefficiencies—the agency underinvests in unobservable effort and overinvests in observable effort. Agencies have no incentive to conceal their activities from the overseer; the reforms that are likely to reduce inefficiency are therefore those that improve overseer expertise or lower the costs of agency disclosure, not those that compel disclosure. The normative implications depend on the relative severity of bureaucratic drift and slack problems. When slack is paramount, an overseer that is more anti-regulation than the agency or society improves social welfare, as long as it does not deter the agency from regulating entirely.

This article presents an empirical analysis of the National Labor Relations Board, focusing on the
balance the agency strikes between the interests of business and labor. It is oriented by a theoretical
framework that, relative to popular models, takes a broader view of the causal structure of regulatory
performance-one that simultaneously allows for presidents, congressional committees, the courts,
agency staff, constituents, and economic conditions. The empirical results are instructive. All of these
factors prove to have significant impacts on NLRB decisions. In addition, the core regulatory actors
-Board members, staff, and constituents-are shown to engage in mutually adaptive adjustment:
each is responsive to the decisions of each of the others, and their reciprocal relationships impart
equilibrating properties to the system as a whole. Thus, the evidence points to a varied set of important
determinants and to the dynamic nature of their interconnection. To the extent that thesefindings
are at all characteristic of other regulatory agencies, simple popular models of regulation are likely to
give anemic explanations, if not highly distorted accounts, of why agencies behave as they do. },

examines the case actions of the National Labor Relations Board, and how the NLRB balanced the interests of business and labor. Moe's model is much broader in the causal factors it allows for, taking into account the president, congressional committees, the courts, agency staff, constituents and overall economic conditions in how the NLRB makes its decisions. All of these factors are found to have an impact on Board decisions, whether it is in the initial filtering of charges by staffers or in the ultimate decisions of board members. Additionally, each set of core actors in this process -constituents, Board members, and Board staff— all adapt and adjust to the actions of other actors in the system. Thus the decision making process is highly dynamic, and

behavior. Extensive collections of texts with clearly recognizable political—as
distinct from religious—content go back as far as 2500 BCE in the case of Mesopotamia
and 1300 BCE for China, and 2400-year-old political discussions dating back to the likes
of Plato, Aristotle, and Thucydides are common fare even in the introductory study of
political thought. Political tracts were among the earliest productions following the
introduction of low-cost printing in Europe—fueling more than a few revolutions
and social upheavals—and continuous printed records of legislative debates, such as
the British parliament's Hansard and precursors tracing to 1802, cover centuries of
political discussion.
The possibility that the analysis of texts could provide insights into the political processes
also has a long pedigree. The Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla's careful philological
analysis of the reputed Donation of Constantine in 1439 convincingly demonstrated, using
purely textual methods, that the document was a medieval forgery that must have postdated
the Emperor Constantine I by at least four centuries. Moving toward our own day, the first
modern, theoretically driven content analysis project was Harold Lasswell's Wartime
Communications Project just prior to the outbreak of World War II (Janowitz 1968),
and subsequently, content analysis became a standard analytical tool in the West, particularly
for the analysis of ‘‘enemy'' communications, first Nazi and later Communist.
Given the tedious nature of human coding, researchers recognized early on that systematic
textual analysis might be suited to automation. Harvard's General Inquirer(Stone et al.
1966) emerged as the first widely used computer program for automated content analysis,
and re-written from the original IBM language PL/1 into Java, it persists to this day.1 However,
most of the development of automated tools within the context of the social sciences
occurred in Europe (see Alexa and Zuell 1999; Popping 2000), though automated natural
language processing in general continued apace in computer science (e.g., Salton 1989;

abstract = {A prominent change in American electoral institutions occurred when the 17th Amendment to the Constitution established direct election ofU.S. Senators as of 1914.How did this change the political agency relationship between the mass electorate and U.S. Senators? We develop theoretical expectations about the representational effects of direct election by a relatively inexpert mass electorate and indirect election by a relatively expert political intermediary, based on principal-agent theory. The chief predictions are that the representative will bemore responsive to the mass electorate under direct election, but will also have more discretion to pursue his or her own ends. We use the 17th Amendment as a quasi-experiment to test the predictions of the theory. Statistical models show strong support for both predictions.Moreover, the 17th Amendment is not associated with similar changes in the U.S. House of Representatives—as expected, since the amendment did not change House electoral institutions.},

Yet no one feels compelled even to try to tell you where the modern world came from, what causes it to hang around, and, by extension, what might cause it to go. Those are the concerns that motivate this volume. To get at them, we need a picture of the overarching structure of American politics at diverse points in time. We need a small set of key elements that repeatedly give structure to this politics. We need an extended period in which these key elements can interact, ideally in differing ways. And we need a process of policy-making that emerges from this interaction, a diagnostic process that can be compared—that itself evolves—across time. At any given point, these elements together contribute the ‘big picture' in American politics. Across time, they tell a story of political stability and, especially, political change.

To explore this question , I consider a simple policymaking environment in which an expert agency develops policy that is upheld or overturned by an overseer who may have different policy goals. The agency can affect the quality of implementation through effort investments in addition to choosing the substantive content of policy. Under procedural review the overseer only reviews the agencys effort, which allows the agency to fully utilize its expertise, but may harm effort incentives. Substantive review also tasks the overseer with judging agencies substantive policy choices, which introduces a fundamental trade-off between agency utilization of expertise and effort investment due to pathological policy choices made by the agency. The theory characterizes when less transparent oversight, procedural review, is optimal relative to more transparent, substantive review. The results speak to when agencies should be insulated from substantive review.},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Reviewing Procedure vs. Judging Substance: The Scope of Review and Bureaucratic Policymaking * - Turner, Ian R)

thinking about when bureaucrats have incentives
to exaggerate or minimize problems in order to get their desired policy. I have a number of related questions, mostly on the assumptions, and a few
half-baked thoughts about alternative ways to describe the parameterization.
1. Why is effort chosen before the policy position? In the introduction, you
discuss investment in effort as implementation capacity, but in the model, it
looks to me more like search costs related to developing expertise in the policy
area. I am having a hard time thinking about a situation where investments are
made in implementation capacity before a rule is made, but there are definitely
costs to making a good rule (i.e. one that can be successfully implemented).
There are also incentives to make rules that can be implemented with existing
capacity, so maybe an alternative way to think about e is the choice to make
a rule that can be implemented given an agency's capacity. Choosing to bear
the search costs of identifying a successful implementation strategy, e = 1, is
costly for the agency and, as per your model, they will not bear these costs if
they are going to get reversed. If they know they are going to get reversed, they
will go into rulemaking with a bad rule (or not go at all, but that is a separate
issue). This seems consistent with e being the subject of procedural review–
which is often more about whether the agency used expertise than whether it
has sufficient implementation capacity. Another, related, way to think about
it is that e is the search cost for the agency to discover {\$}\omega{\$} with a greater level
of precision. I think this is the cleanest way to think about e. Here, instead
of observing investment in capacity or in identifying policy mechanisms, the
agency may be conducting hearings, commissioning reports, and RFIs to learn
about {\$}\omega{\$}. This also seems consistent with procedural review based on expertise
and good process. Either way, thinking about e as search costs gets you out
of the question about who really sets the budget for implementation capacity.
This leads to my next question:
2. To what extent is investment in capacity for successful implementation a
choice that agencies really face? The model assumes that agency investments
are based on their incentives. Are bureaucrats naturally lazy and principals
demanding procedural goals like equal protection etc. can incentivize them to
“work harder,” or are bureaucrats more often the ones pushing for successful
implementation and procedural fairness (indeed, their careers are often longer
than their principals' and they are closer to the harms that may come to people)
but their elected principals either (1) don't give them enough resources or (2)
don't actually want equal protection. I see the withholding of investments and
policy with racial or class biases emerging more from elected officials than from
bureaucrats or courts.
For example, did FEMA not invest in better computers because they did
not want to or because Congress did not give them enough money? In the story
in your presentation, it seemed like FEMA used the computer failure to argue
for more money, and then they got it. Perhaps FEMA should have submitted a
Turner, Reviewing Procedure vs. Judging Substance Judge-Lord Notes
budget request for a new computer system earlier, but it seems they would have
likely been overturned by either the White House the appropriations committee
until FEMA could claim that a crisis demanded more money.1
3. Do agencies care more about policies in which they have sunk costs?
Assuming that investment in costs like computer systems are chosen by the
agency and that they are chosen before the policy position, the model predicts
that they are more likely to lie about the state of the world when they have
a high e. Why is e part of their utility function at the point where they are
deciding whether to lie or not? Once they know the state of the world, should
not the agency always tell the principal whatever is likely to avoid reversal,
regardless of whether they have sunk costs? Perhaps this result comes from the
fact that e is in the principal's utility function, leading to my next question:
4. Do overseers care about sunk costs in a program with which they disagree?
The paper concludes that higher effort investments lead to more deference because
it lowers the error. Why do they want high-quality implementation /
cerianty of a policy they dislike?
5. The setup has principals always preferring less action to more. This is
not the case and it seems possible to capture the reverse in this model, i.e.
when {\$}\beta{\$} or {\$}\omega{\$} is negative the principal prefers more policy action, right? If a
model with negative {\$}\omega{\$} or {\$}\beta{\$} gets us the same mathematical results, this would
mean that when {\$}\omega{\$} or {\$}\beta{\$} is negative, then the substantive result is the opposite
of “crying wolf”–I am not sure what to call this, minimizing? But in this world,
does the principal still have the same incentives not to overturn? If an agency
is minimizing a problem, then they care less about overturning than they ought
to and might be more likely to do it when {\$}\beta{\$} is high. I am not sure if I am
thinking about this correctly, but it seems interesting.
6. Ealy in the paper, {\$}\beta{\$} is called “bias,” but later you call it “preferences
divergence”–I prefer thinking about it the latter way. I would find it more clear
if we could say that {\$}\omega{\$} is the agency's ideal point and {\$}\omega{\$} − {\$}\beta{\$} is the principal's
ideal point, assuming a high cost to reversing for high values of {\$}\omega{\$}, right? This
seems to allow us to take seriously the idea that the agency does have an ideal
point, {\$}\omega{\$}, it is just uncertain about what policy x best satisfies it until the state
of the world is revealed (or until it bears [search] costs e). I find it more intuitive
to speak about agency and principal preferences rather than states of the world.
You offer the insight that when potential costs of inaction are high, principals
are more willing to tolerate more divergent agency policies. Currently, the
model assumes that those costs are co-determined with what the agency wants
(i.e. both a wrapped up in {\$}\omega{\$}). I am fine with that. Principals may very well
interpret extreme agency preferences as a signal that the costs of inaction are
high, especially if agencies are fairly sincere in their pursuit of the public good
and have expertise in their subject area.

Devin
1This reminds me that budgets are another form of proposal, subject to rejection by principals,
but I am not sure budget proposals fit in your model. If they do, let me know because I
have collected a bunch of data on agency budget proposals and corresponding appropriations.

abstract = {Economics does not now provide a theory of the maximizing bureaucrat.
The currently dominant approach to public administration is to
provide the organizational structure, information system, and analysis
to bureaucrats who, for whatever reason, want to be efficient. This
approach, however, does not develop, or explicitly recognize as relevant,
the conditions for which the personal objectives of the bureaucrat are
consistent with the efficiency of the bureaucracy.
At present, with a large and increasing proportion of economic activity
being conducted in bureaus, economists have made no substantial
contribution to answering the following questions: What are the distinguishing
characteristics of bureaucracies? What are the critical
elements of a theory of bureaucracy? Specifically, what do bureaucrats
maximize and under what external conditions? What are the consequences
of maximizing behavior under these conditions? For example,
what is the equilibrium output and budget of a bureau for given demand
and cost conditions? What are the effects of changes in demand and
cost conditions? What are the welfare consequences of bureaucratic
organization of economic activity? What changes in organization and
the structure of rewards would improve the efficiency of a bureaucracy?
This paper presents a simple model of the maximizing bureaucrat and,
based on this model, a set of tentative qualitative answers to these
questions.
II. The Model
The model outlined in this section is based on the following two
critical characteristics of bureaus: (1) Bureaucrats maximize the total
budget of their bureau, given demand and cost conditions, subject to
the constraint that the budget must be equal to or greater than the minimum
total costs at the equilibrium output. (2) Bureaus exchange a
specific output (or combination of outputs) for a specific budget. For
this paper, thus, bureaus are defined by these two characteristics.
Among the several variables that may enter the bureaucrat's utility
function are the following: salary, perquisites of the office, public reputation,
power, patronage, ease of managing the bureau, and },

abstract = {The Politics of Precedent on the U.S. Supreme Courtoffers an insightful and provocative analysis of the Supreme Court's most important task--shaping the law. Thomas Hansford and James Spriggs analyze a key aspect of legal change: the Court's interpretation or treatment of the precedents it has set in the past. Court decisions do not just resolve immediate disputes; they also set broader precedent. The meaning and scope of a precedent, however, can change significantly as the Court revisits it in future cases. The authors contend that these interpretations are driven by an interaction between policy goals and variations in the legal authoritativeness of precedent. From this premise, they build an explanation of the legal interpretation of precedent that yields novel predictions about the nature and timing of legal change. Hansford and Spriggs test their hypotheses by examining how the Court has interpreted the precedents it set between 1946 and 1999. This analysis provides compelling support for their argument, and demonstrates that the justices' ideological goals and the role of precedent are inextricably linked. The two prevailing, yet contradictory, views of precedent--that it acts either solely as a constraint, or as a "cloak" that never actually influences the Court--are incorrect. This book shows that while precedent can operate as a constraint on the justices' decisions, it also represents an opportunity to foster preferred societal outcomes.},

The decisions that elites make when casting roll call votes seem to provide an ideal opportunity for measuring elite preferences and testing theories of the political process. The fact that the resulting ideal points are a consequence of applying a statistical model to a model of individual choice, however, may affect their usefulness for measuring elite preferences and testing predictions regarding individual and collective decision making. When analyzing roll call votes, scholars should be mindful of how their decisions may affect the estimates from their analyses. I use simulations to illustrate how the nonrandom selection of roll calls may affect the ability to estimate ideal points that accurately reflect the preferences responsible for generating the observed votes, and I discuss work integrating the many models involved in the production and consumption of roll call estimates.},

Moreover, we find that senators ask more probing questions than in the past, and that nomineess are now more explicit about their reasons when they choose not to respond-two factors that may be fueling the perception that evasiveness has increased in recent years.

abstract = {This article addresses three questions about notice and comment rule rulemaking. The first considers who participates: Who submits comments to federal agencies during the notice and comment period? The second considers the extent to which the comments alter the content of the rules. The third is about evaluating agency rule making in the context of the iron triangle and issue network models of policy making. The article examines eleven rules selected randomly at the EPA, NHTSA, and HUD. Among the findings are. a dearth of citizen commenters, the predominance of participation by business interests, and the presence of issue networks, and the absence of any discernible bias in whose voices get heard. The article concludes by suggesting that agencies fail to hear from all affected parties but that they are nonetheless put in the precarious position of arbitrating among competing interests. In the textbook version of American politics, Congress is responsible for law making. This has led scholars to study the legislative process and to pay particular attention to the role of interest groups in that process. However, particularly since the 1960s, Congress has delegated significant portions of its law-making responsibilities to federal administrative agencies. The administrative analogue to law making is known as rule making-the process by which federal agencies issue regulations. We are all familiar with these regulations-EPA regulations dictate the standards that our cars must meet with respect to auto emissions, FDA regulations govern the labels that appear on the products we buy at the supermarket, SEC regulations determine the information provided to shareholders-and they are a major determinant of public policy. However, there is an important distinction between congressional law making and agency rule making. Although},

abstract = {We enter the debate over the role of sex in judging by addressing the two predominant empirical questions it raises: whether male and female judges decide cases distinctly (“individual effects”) and whether the presence of a female judge on a panel causes her male colleagues to behave differently (“panel effects”). We do not, however, rely exclusively on the predominant statistical models— variants of standard regression analysis—to address them. Because these tools alone are ill-suited to the task at hand, we deploy a more appropriate methodology—non-parametric matching—which follows from a formal framework for causal inference. Applying matching methods to sex discrimination suits resolved in the federal circuits between 1995 and 2002 yields two clear results. First, we observe substantial individual effects: The like- lihood of a judge deciding in favor of the party alleging discrimination decreases by about 10 percentage points when the judge is a male. Likewise, we find that men are significantly more likely to rule in favor of the rights litigant when a woman serves on the panel. Both effects are so persistent and consistent that they may come as a surprise even to those scholars who have long posited the existence of gendered judging.},

T This theory asserts that preexisting institutional loyalty shapes perceptions of and judgments about court decisions and events. In this article, we use the theory of positivity bias to investigate the preferences of Americans regarding the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. More specifically, from the theory of positivity bias, we derive the hypothesis that preferences on the Alito confirmation are shaped by anterior commitments to the Supreme Court. Based on an analysis of a national panel survey, we find that those who have a high level toward the Supreme Court rely much more heavily on what we term judiciousness--in contrast to ideology, policy, and partisanship--in forming their opinions on whether or confirm Alito. Thus, institutional loyalty provides a decisive frame through which Americans view the activity of their Supreme Court.},

But little is understood about the second. In this landmark book, a leading scholar of congressional studies draws on extensive interviews and congressional documents to uncover when and how members of congress participate at the subcommittee, committee, and floor stages of legislative decision making. Richard L. Hall develops an original theory to account for varying levels of participation across members and issues, within House and Senate, and across pre- and postreform periods of the modern Congress. By closely analyzing behavior on sixty bills in the areas of agriculture, human resources, and commerce, Hall finds that participation at each stage of the legislative process is rarely universal and never equal. On any given issue, most members who are eligible to participate forego the opportunity to do so, leaving a self-selected few to deliberate on the policy. These active members often do not reflect the values and interests evident in their parent chamber. A deeper understanding of congressional participation, the author contends, informs related inquiries into how well members of congress represent constituents' interests, what factors influence legislative priorities, how members gain legislative leverage on specific issues, and how well collective choice in Congress meets democratic standards of representative deliberation.},

More specifically, we argue that previous congressional overrides in an issue area and case-level interest group activity make congressional preferences salient for the justices. In these threat situations, the justices will be most likely to shift their final votes on the merits in a manner congruent with the preferences of Congress. Based on our logit analysis of data on all orally argued statutory cases from 1963 to 1995, we find mixed support for our hypotheses and conclude that there are limited conditions under which congressional preferences may influence a justice's vote.},

Beneath those labels are factions that have goals, incentives, and resources that conflict with the larger party in which they reside. This book provides the first full account of the role of national intra-party "factions" in American politics. A faction, as defined here, is a party sub-unit that has enough ideological consistency, organizational capacity, and temporal durability to sustain intra-party conflict. Factions are loosely organized networks made up of members of Congress, party activists, pressure groups, policy entrepreneurs, and intellectuals. They are engines of political change that develop new ideas, refine them into workable policies, and promote them in government. Because America's big-tent parties are cumbersome instruments, factions help account for changes in public policy, modes of electoral mobilization, and the parties' ideological positions. This study explains how factions' shape the parties' ideologies, impact presidential nominations, distribute power in Congress, structure patterns of presidential governance, and impact the development of the American state. It shows how factions are often as or more important than the parties in driving political change. Ultimately, by trying to command the party in which they reside, factions seek the authority to put their stamp on the nation.},

How has that institutional environment changed over time and what have been the political consequences of those changes? Despite considerable analysis of the institutional dynamics of legislatures and executives, political scientists have been slow to bring time series techniques to the study of the Supreme Court, and as a result much less is known about its evolutionary path. Measuring a variety of organizational characteristics, I construct an index of the institutionalization of the Supreme Court from 1790 to 1996. This indicator suggests that the integration of the Court into the system of federal policy making has better enabled the justices to satisfy their objectives.

The impetus for structural innovation arises from stresses in the organization's external environment or internal dynamics; processes of adjusting to such stresses are termed, respectively, adaptation and consolidation.

The theory is applied to three innovations proposed by the House Select Committee on Committees (1974): committee realignment; oversight reform; and early House organization. Representing varying levels of adaptation and consolidation, these innovations manifested different origins, forms, and support patterns.

Usually, American politics is looked on as relatively consensual and nonideological, but John Gerring argues that American party history and, by extension, American political history at large have been irreducibly ideological. He contends that the major parties have articulated views that were, and are, coherent, differentiated, and stable. The argument rests on evidence provided by election rhetoric - speeches, party platforms, and other campaign tracts disseminated by party leaders during presidential campaigns. Using these texts, Professor Gerring traces the values, beliefs, and issue-positions that have defined party life from the 1830s to the 1990s.

Past research on legislative voting and elections suggests that voters punish members who are ideologically “out of step” with their districts. In seeking to move beyond the emphasis in the literature on the effects of ideological extremity on legislative vote share, we examine how partisan loyalty can adversely affect legislators' electoral fortunes. Specifically, we estimate the effects of each legislator's party unity—the tendency of a member to vote with his or her party on salient issues that divide the two major parties—on vote margin when running for reelection. Our results suggest that party loyalty on divisive votes can indeed be a liability for incumbent House members. In fact, we find that voters are not punishing elected representatives for being too ideological; they are punishing them for being too partisan.},

Gridlock is in fact the order of the day, occurring even when the same party controls the legislative and executive branches. Meticulously researched and anchored to real politics, Krehbiel argues that the pivotal vote on a piece of legislation is not the one that gives a bill a simple majority, but the vote that allows its supporters to override a possible presidential veto or to put a halt to a filibuster. This theory of pivots also explains why, when bills are passed, winning coalitions usually are bipartisan and supermajority sized. Offering an incisive account of when gridlock is overcome and showing that political parties are less important in legislative-executive politics than previously thought, Pivotal Politics remakes our understanding of American lawmaking.},

However, conflicting theoretical and empirical findings have given rise to a significant discrepancy in the scholarship. Building on evidence from interviews with Supreme Court justices and former law clerks, I develop a formal model of judicial-congressional relations that incorporates judicial preferences for institutional legitimacy and the role of public opinion in congressional hostility towards the Supreme Court. An original dataset identifying all Court-curbing legislation proposed between 1877 and 2006 is then used to assess the influence of congressional hostility on the Court's use of judicial review. The evidence indicates that public discontent with the Court, as mediated through congressional hostility, creates an incentive for the Court to exercise self-restraint. When Congress is hostile, the Court uses judicial review to invalidate Acts of Congress less frequently than when Congress is not hostile towards the Court.},

Yet, an examination of the interrelationship between formal, procedural constraints and the informal processes surrounding them reveals that the effects of notice and comment in promoting bureaucratic responsiveness are limited in ways that have received little systematic analysis.

Does heavy auditing encourage it to substitute multiple small regulations in place of single large

regulation production functions for federal agencies, using data from the Unified Agenda

regulatory commissions. Our data uncover no evidence of a chilling effect in the production of
economically significant regulations due to the Bush administration's regulatory auditing,
relative to the Clinton or early Obama administrations. Nor do we find any evidence of OIRA
avoidance. We do find some evidence that the Bush administration reduced the production of
noneconomically significant regulations overall. However, the effect appears to be due to appointments
in the agencies. Overall, the results raise questions about the efficacy of presidential efforts

To support these claims, I develop a model of distributive policymaking subject to an executive veto. This framework incorporates variation in presidential objectives and formal powers into a dynamic bargaining model. In equilibrium, stronger veto power leads to a lower level of distributive spending, but the effects are mitigated to the extent that the president prefers spending in some districts over others. The model also generates new insights and predictions about fiscal policy under the separation of powers, including the effects of divided government, electoral rules, and term limitations for the executive.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that the American people are woefully ignorant about law and courts. In light of this putative ignorance, scholars and other commentators have questioned whether the public should play a role in the judicial process - for example, whether public preferences should matter for U.S. Supreme Court confirmation processes. Unfortunately, however, much of what we know - or think we know - about public knowledge of the Supreme Court is based upon flawed measures and procedures. So, for instance, the American National Election Study, a prominent source of the conclusion that people know little if anything about the U.S. Supreme Court, codes as inccorect the reply that William Rehnquist is (was) a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court; respondents, to be judged knowledgable, must identify Rehnquist as the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (which, of course, technically he was not). More generally, the use of open-ended recall questions leads to a serious and substantial underestimation of the extent to which ordinary people know about the nation's highest court. Our purpose in this paper is to revisit the question of how knowledgable the American people are about the Supreme Court. Based on two national surveys - using more appropriate, closed-ended questions - we demonstrate that levels of knowledge about the Court and its justices are far higher than nearly all ealier surveys have documented. And, based on an experiment embedded in one of hte national surveys, we also show the dramatic effect of question-form on estimates of levels of knowledge. Finally, we draw out the implications of political knowledge for thedegree to which people support the U.S. Supreme Court. Our findings indicate that greater knowledge of the Court is associated with stronger loyalty toward the institution. We conclude by reconnecting these findings to ``postiivity theory,'' which asserts that paying attention to courtsd not only provides citizens information, but also exposes them to powerful symbols of judicial legitimacy.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of bureaucratic decision costs on agency expertise. The analysis shows that the effect of the cost associated with adopting a new regulation (the "enactment cost") on agency expertise depends on what the agency would do if it remains uninformed. If an uninformed agency would regulate, increasing enactment costs increases agency expertise; if an uninformed agency would retain the status quo, increasing enactment costs decreases agency expertise. These results may influence the behavior of an uninformed overseer, such as a court or legislature, that can manipulate the agency's enactment costs. Such an overseer must balance its interest in influencing agency policy preferences against its interest in increasing agency expertise. The paper explores the implications of these results for various topics in institutional design, including judicial and executive review of regulations, structure-and-process theories of congressional oversight, national security, criminal procedure, and constitutional law.},

Aggregate polling and election data from the 50 states and District of Columbia indicate whether a minor party candidate's support rose or fell between the final poll and Election Day. A negative vote-poll gap is evidence of classic strategic voting while a positive vote-poll gap is evidence of expressive strategic voting. Expressive voting was widespread in 1992 and 1996, but instrumental voting was dominant in 2000. In 2000 Ralph Nader lost support in most states, particularly those where the major party contest was competitive. In contrast, Ross Perot gained in most states due to expressive strategic voting facilitated by the noncompetitive national race. I also show that the vote-poll gap is a product of changes in voter turnout and, to a lesser extent, elite mobilization. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We develop a model of "notice and comment" rulemaking, focussing on strategic issues facing agencies and interest groups in light of judicial review in this process. Specifically, we analyse the incentives for agencies and groups to produce and reveal information during rulemaking. We show that judicial review can produce informed policymaking, but that participatory rulemaking can bias agency policymaking in favour of groups with access to the rule-making process. In addition, the model allows an analysis of doctrines of judicial review of agency policymaking. The model reveals that "politicised" judicial review can be beneficial because of its effects on agency incentives for information acquisition in policymaking. Accordingly, socially optimal judicial review may be "legally irrational" and, contrary to standard doctrines of judicial review in the United States, judicial deference to rules with thin records can be optimal. Key words: bureaucratic rulemaking, information and expertise, judicial review, notice and comment Modern government is bureaucratic. However, bureaucrats face only indirect and limited forms of popular accountability, and yet they also lack the independence of the judiciary. Thus, their discretion over public policy has the potential to threaten cherished principles of both representative government and due process. Essentially, bureaucrats are not political enough to fall directly under conventional sanctions of democratic accountability, but are too political to guarantee observance of due process on their own. As the reach and importance of bureaucratic government have grown in the United States (US), Congress and courts have responded with legislation},

In the model, a legislative principal decides whether to delegate the power to an agency to regulate the activities of a firm or industry. The policy domain is complex in that knowledge of the implications of different policy choices is concentrated in the firm. The agency can learn about the policy environment only through monitoring the firm's efforts at self-regulation. The main result is that, as policy becomes more complex, regulatory outcomes are increasingly biased toward those preferred by the firm. Moreover, when the agency has preferences that diverge from the firm's, the firm invests less in its own self-regulatory efforts for fear that its policy investments will be expropriated.},

This concern threw into relief the prevailing notion that—such unusually competitive cases notwithstanding—people, rather than parties, should and do control presidential nominations. But for the past several decades, The Party Decides shows, unelected insiders in both major parties have effectively selected candidates long before citizens reached the ballot box.Tracing the evolution of presidential nominations since the 1790s, this volume demonstrates how party insiders have sought since America's founding to control nominations as a means of getting what they want from government. Contrary to the common view that the party reforms of the 1970s gave voters more power, the authors contend that the most consequential contests remain the candidates' fights for prominent endorsements and the support of various interest groups and state party leaders. These invisible primaries produce frontrunners long before most voters start paying attention, profoundly influencing final election outcomes and investing parties with far more nominating power than is generally recognized.},

Systematic research on campaign contributions and members' floor voting, however, provides little supporting evidence. We develop a view of the member-donor relationship that questions the theoretical underpinnings of the vote-buying hypothesis itself and suggests two alternative claims: (1) the effects of group expenditures are more likely to appear in committee than on the floor; and (2) the behavior most likely to be affected is members' legislative involvement, not their votes. In order to test this account, we specify a model of committee participation and estimate it using data from three House committees. In contrast to the substantial literature on contributions and roll calls, our analysis provides solid support for the importance of moneyed interests in the legislative process. We also find evidence that members are more responsive to organized business interests within their districts than to unorganized voters even when voters have strong preferences and the issue at stake is salient. Such findings suggest several important implications for our understanding of political money, interest groups, and the representativeness of legislative deliberations.},

We investigate the relationship between incumbents' electoral performance and roll-call support for their party-controlling for district ideology, challenger quality, and campaign spending, among other factors-through a series of tests of the 1956-1996 elections. The tests produce three key findings indicating that members are indeed accountable for their legislative voting. First, in each election, an incumbent receives a lower vote share the more he supports his party. Second, this effect is comparable in size to that of other widely recognized electoral determinants. Third, a member's probability of retaining office decreases as he offers increased support for his party, and this relationship holds for not only marginal, but also safe members.},

In addition, members with higher analytical capacity tend to disengage from discussions of the symbolic aspects of policies that are of interest to constituents.

The dataset allows us to quantify for the fist time such things as which issues are most frequently discussed at the hearings, whether those issues have changed over time, and whether they vary depending on the party of the appointing president and the party of the questioning senator. We also investigate if questioning patterns differ depending on the race or gender of the nominee. Some of our results are unsurprising: for example, the hearings have become longer. Others, however, challenge conventional wisdom: the Bork hearing is less of an outlier in several ways than is frequently assumed, and abortion has not dominated the hearings. We also discover that there is issue area variation over time, and that there are notable disparities in the issues addressed by Democratic versus Republican senators. Finally, we find that female and minority nominees face a significantly different hearing environment than do white male nominees.},

However, unless we recognize the several barriers to making rulemaking a more broadly participatory process, and purposefully adapt Web 2.0 technologies and methods to lower those barriers, Rule-making 2.0 is likely to disappoint agencies and open government advocates alike.

This article describes the design, operation and initial results of Regulation Room, a pilot public rulemaking participation platform created by a cross-disciplinary group of Cornell researchers in collaboration with the Department of Transportation. (A companion article, Rulemaking in 140 Characters or Less: Social Networking and Public Participation in Rulemaking, is forthcoming in Pace Law Review.) Regulation Room uses selected live rulemakings to experiment with human and computer support for public comment. The ultimate project goal is to provide guidance on design, technological, and human intervention strategies, grounded in theory and tested in practice, for effective Rulemaking 2.0 systems. Early results give some cause for optimism about the open-government potential of Web 2.0 - supported rulemaking. But significant challenges remain. Broader, better public participation is hampered by 1) ignorance of the rulemaking process; 2) unawareness that rulemakings of interest are going on; and 3) information overload from the length and complexity of rulemaking materials. No existing, commonly used Web services or applications are good analogies for what a Rulemaking 2.0 system must do to lower these barriers. To be effective, the system must not only provide the right mix of technology, content, and human assistance to support users in the unfamiliar environment of complex government policy-making; it must also spur them to revise their expectations about how they engage information on the Web and also, perhaps, about what is required for civic participation.},

abstract = {Each year, administrative agencies issue thousands of rules with substantial social and economic ramifications. Yet, many observers remain wary of administrative policymaking. One significant reason is that rulemaking has a "democracy deficit." Public participation during rulemaking is sporadic and unrepresentative. But what do high or low levels of public participation during rulemaking tell us about bias in regulators or regulation? This paper explores this question by modeling rulemaking as a persuasion game. The model shows that known patterns of public participation in rulemaking are inconsistent with total capture or absolute zealotry. Such patterns are consistent, however, with almost any other level of bias in the policy or the policymaker's decision-making, provided one fails to account for variability in outside actors' stakes in regulatory outcomes.

Mayhew's (1974) thesis regarding the “electoral connection” and its impact on legislative behavior has become the theoretical foundation for much of the research on the contemporary U.S. Congress. Recently, scholars have begun to suggest that the Mayhewian electoral incentive may apply to politics in earlier congressional eras as well. To assess these claims more systematically, we consider four conditions that serve as the building blocks of the electoral connection—ambition, autonomy, responsiveness, and accountability. Through a detailed review of the literature on electoral politics in Congress, we discover that all four conditions were present in a strict sense as far back as the Progressive Era. Moreover, considerable evidence suggests that a weaker, less formalized version of the electoral connection existed even earlier in American history. We conclude by briefly discussing the implications of these findings on the rapidly growing literature examining the historical and institutional evolution of Congress.},

abstract = {Conventional accounts of retrospective voting assume that voters can use changes in their own welfare to discern whether incumbent leaders have governed well or badly. We challenge this assumption, arguing that the connection between incumbents' performance and voters' subjective well-being is likely to be highly random. As a result, retrospective voting is harder than it seems, and incumbents often get rewarded or punished for events beyond their control. We illustrate this point by tracing the electoral impact of a clearly random event—a dramatic series of shark attacks in New Jersey in 1916. We show that voters in the affected communities significantly punished the incumbent president, Woodrow Wilson, at the polls. We also develop a simple formal model demonstrating that the randomness of “blind retrospection” significantly impairs the effectiveness of elections as mechanisms for political accountability.},

Our analysis resolves this disparity, developing a theoretical perspective of plebiscitary appeals and testing it on data from the nation- ally televised addresses of Presidents Eisenhower through Clinton. The perspective suggests that appeals should generate influence, but that this influence depends on presidents strategically choosing issues to pro- mote to the public. In particular, a president will promote issues on which his position is popular, but for which Congress would not otherwise enact his preferred policy. To test this perspective, we analyze a simulta- neous-equations model of the causes and policy consequences of pres- idential appeals over budgetary policy.

The theory shows that presidents can obtain influence from not only the act, but also the threat of public agenda setting. However, even when the action is costless, presidents can not always achieve policy goals from it. When a president does not want Congress to become more responsive to public opinion, or when the status quo is not extreme relative to his/her preferred outcome and voters' preferences, the president lacks a policy-based incentive to increase the salience of an issue.

abstract = {We propose that Congress controls the flow and content of information to the bureaucracy by creating federal advisory committees with member-ship rights for general categories of interests. We use data on the ap-pointment of members to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), an advisory committee within the Environmental Protection Agency, to test whether the active interests in the legislative debate over drinking water are represented on the advisory committee, and thus in the EPA's policymaking process. Al-though agency officials are respon-sible for appointing the members of NDWAC, we find that public endorse-ments by interest groups are influen-tial in the agency's selection process. These groups provide reliable infor-mation to Congress about applicants' true policy preferences. ne of the persistent power struggles in American national politics is that between Congress and the bureaucracy. Scholars have $\backslash$ theorized that the outcome of this struggle depends significantly on which institution has superior information about the costs and conse-quences of policy implementation (Banks and Weingast 1992; Bendor, Tay-lor, and Van Gaalen 1985; Miller and Moe 1984). When agencies have an informational advantage, they can often implement programs at higher costs and with different beneficiaries than intended by Congress. To limit bureaucratic discretion in policy making, Congress must control the infor-mation available to agencies. The information available to agencies depends, among other factors, on the number and kind of interested parties that participate in agency proceedings. Through formal comments, ex parte communications, hear-ings, stakeholder meetings, and other forums, agencies collect information about the costs and consequences of policy options in some of the same ways as Congress collects information. Policy information across the two institutions is likely to correspond when both Congress and agencies collect information from the same parties. If policy decisions depend on available information, then the more closely information corresponds between insti-tutions, the more likely policy decisions will correspond as well. Our question in this article is "To what extent, and by what means, do interests that realize representation in Congress also realize representation in the bureaucracy?" Our explanation parallels the "structure and process" ar-gument of McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast (1987, 1989) and the informa-tional theories of Gilligan and Krehbiel (1987) and others.

abstract = {Power and movement: two words that seldom appear together in learned or popular discourse. Yet all through history, ordinary people have erupted into the streets and exerted considerable power-if only briefly. In the last thirty years, alone, the American Civil Rights movement, the peace, environmental and feminist movements, and revolts against authoritarianism all over the world have brought masses of people into the streets demanding change. They often succeeded; but even when they failed, their movements had profound effects, and set in motion important political and international changes. Power in movement grows when ordinary people join forces in contentious confrontation with elites, authorities and opponents. Mounting, coordinating and sustaining this interaction is the peculiar contribution of the social movement. Movements are created when political opportunities open up for social actors who usually lack them. They draw people into collective action through known repertoires of contention and by creating innovations around their margins. At their base are the social networks and cultural symbols through which social relations are organized. The denser the former and the more familiar the latter, the more likely movements are to spread and be sustained. Triggered by the incentives created by political opportunities, combining conventional and challenging forms of action and building on social networks and cultural frames is how movements overcome the obstacles to collective action and sustain their interactions with opponents and with the state. How they do so, and the dynamics and outcomes of the protest cycles they produce, are the main subjects of this book. There are three major puzzles in the relations between power and movement. First, although ordinary people possess the resources for collective action during many periods of history, they mainly accept their fate or rise up timidly, only to be repressed. Under what conditions does the power in movement arise? A second question relates to the dynamics of movement.

The first book to systematically distinguish Senate disputes centering on ideological questions from the large proportion of them that do not, this volume foregrounds the role of power struggle in partisan conflict. Presidential leadership, for example, inherently polarizes legislators who can influence public opinion of the president and his party by how they handle his agenda. Senators also exploit good government measures and floor debate to embarrass opponents and burnish their own party's image—even when the issues involved are broadly supported or low-stakes. Moreover, Lee contends, the congressional agenda itself amplifies conflict by increasingly focusing on issues that reliably differentiate the parties.

The underlying principles are the majoritarian principle, in which "objects of legislative choice in both the procedural and policy domains must be chosen by a majority of the legislature", and the uncertainty principle, which states that "legislators are often uncertain about the relationships between policies and their outcomes." Both distributive and informational approaches rely on the majoritarian principle, but the distributive theory takes institutional arrangements as given as oposed to being put in place by a majority of the legislature. More central to the informational theory is the concept that legislators are uncertain about outcomes of policies, and thus it is in their interest to induce specializaiton and then incorporate rules that minimize the possibility of particularistic benefits or shirking of institutional maintenance. Much of the uncertainty approach is couched in signalling theory, which predicts much of the behavior that the parent chamber vis-a-vis the committee characteristics and actions.

abstract = {The Civil Rights Act of 1991 overrode twelve recent Supreme Court decisions interpreting federal civil rights and related statutes. This statute, as well as other recent congressional override efforts, presents scholars with an opportunity to revisit longstanding debates about congressional awareness of and responsiveness to Supreme Court statutory interpretation decisions, theories of the legislative process and the interaction between the Court and Congress, and the implications of these debates for the theory and practice of statutory interpretation. Overriding Supreme Court Statutory Interpretation Decisions is an empirical and theoretical study of congressional overrides of Supreme Court statutory interpretation decisions between 1967 and 1990. The Article makes several contributions to our understanding of the Court/Congress dynamics and statutory interpretation. First, the Article is a thorough catalogue and analysis of overrides. The study finds that 121 Supreme Court statutory interpretation decisions were overridden during this period, an average of ten per Congress. From this data and from a more selective survey of failed override efforts, the Article concludes that congressional committees in fact carefully monitor Supreme Court decisions and that Congress is particularly prone to override decisions that reflect a closely divided Court favoring conservative interpretations, decisions that rely on the statute's plain meaning and canons of statutory construction, and decisions that reject positions taken by federal, state, and local governments. Second, the Article uses data and case studies to synthesize a theoretical model that deepens our understanding of the interaction between the Court, Congress, and the President in statutory interpretation. The model posits that a dynamic game exists among the Court, the relevant congressional committees, Congress, and the President. Under this "Court/Congress/President game," ultimate statutory policy is set through a sequential process by which each player tries to impose its policy preferences on the others. The game is a dynamic one, because each player is responsive to the preferences of the other players and because the preferences of the players change as information is generated and distributed. Third, the Article applies the empirical and theoretical analysis to rethink issues of statutory interpretation. Descriptively, a central theme is that the Court's statutory interpretation decisions are more responsive to the expectations of the current Congress and President than to those of the enacting Congress. Normatively, the Court's role emerges as an important institution contributing to the operation of our pluralist political system. This role is subject to question. While rejecting the criticism that the Court should only attend to statutory text or original intent, this Article argues that the Court's practice fails to give sufficient attention to interests unrepresented in our pluralist system.},

o   Gridlock 
Politicians and pundits alike have complained that the divided governments of the last decades have led to legislative gridlock. Not so, argues Keith Krehbiel, who advances the provocative theory that divided government actually has little effect on legislative productivity. Gridlock is in fact the order of the day, occurring even when the same party controls the legislative and executive branches. Meticulously researched and anchored to real politics, Krehbiel argues that the pivotal vote on a piece of legislation is not the one that gives a bill a simple majority, but the vote that allows its supporters to override a possible presidential veto or to put a halt to a filibuster. This theory of pivots also explains why, when bills are passed, winning coalitions usually are bipartisan and supermajority sized. Offering an incisive account of when gridlock is overcome and showing that political parties are less important in legislative-executive politics than previously thought, Pivotal Politics remakes our understanding of American lawmaking.Krishna and Morgan propose "amendments" to two of Gilligan and Krehbiel's theoretical studies of legislative signaling. The new results for homogeneous committees do not significantly change the empirical expectations of prior works, but the results for heterogeneous committees contradict earlier claims. This note gives primary attention to heterogeneous committees and compares and contrasts the new and old equilibria and their empirical implications. The notion of signaling is somewhat nebulous in all such games but seems distinctly less plausible in the key Krishna-Morgan proposition than in previous legislative signaling games. Furthermore, the empirical literature on choice of rules-specifically, the finding of a positive relationship between committee heterogeneity and restrictive rules-is inconsistent with the Krishna-Morgan analysis but consistent with Gilligan-Krehbiel analyses, even though the former is informationally efficient and the latter are not.






Two classes of models that reflect how legislators make collective choices have become increasingly sophisticated in the last decade. Structure-induced equilibrium models explain stable outcomes in terms of the structural attributes of the legislature. Recent game-theoretic models offer explanations of some nonobvious regularities in legislative behavior in terms of uncertainty about procedures and differential access to information. The increasing realism and attendant complexity of these models enable them to address interesting substantive questions and to offer theoretical explanations that are subject to empirical verification.




See Krehbiel summary notes. Helps explain gridlock via VETO players. Krehbiel develops a simple, spatial model of lawmaking in the U.S. Congress. He argues that focusing on the policy positions of "pivotal" voters such as the person crucial to ending a filibuster or overriding a presidential veto, instead of divided government, is the proper way to study the causes and consequences of legislative gridlock.




A spatial theory of the comparative consequences of unified and divided government clarifies the relationship between institutions, partisanship and gridlock. Under formally specified conditions, executive and legislative institutions are shown to inhibit but not prohibit the convergence of public policies to those most preferred by the legislative median voter. Extensions illustrate the theoretical robustness of the primary empirical expectation. Under all but extreme conditions, gridlock is a predictable consequence of super-majoritarian procedures. Gridlock occurs in divided and unified government alike, and in the presence of any degree of party strength. Concluding discussions speculate on the effects of alternative assumptions and on applications of the theoretical framework to settings other than US national government.




Political parties are prominent in legislative politics and legislative research. Using data from the 99th Congress, this article assesses the degree to which significant party behaviour - defined and operationalized as behaviour that is independent of preferences - occurs in two key stages of legislative organization: the formation of standing committees and the appointment of con- ferees. Four hypotheses are developed and tested. When controlling for preferences and other hypothesized effects, positive and significant party effects are rare. A discussion addresses some criticisms of this unorthodox approach and attempts to reconcile some differences between these and previous findings. Political},

Conclusions regarding friendly versus confrontational lobbying of congressional committees are misleading without consideration of biases in committee representation. Relying on measures of congressional committee members' ideology and interest group ideology and lobbying behavior, I use bivariate correlation and t-tests to examine behavioral patterns of interest group and committee interactions. There is a correlation between the ideologies of interest groups lobbying committees and the ideologies of those committees, but this stems more from the general agreement among groups and committees in the same issue areas rather than from deliberate choices by groups. If conservative (liberal) groups lobby conservative (liberal) committees, it is because the set of interest groups active in the issue area tend to be conservative (liberal). Furthermore, committees tend to share the same biases as the interest groups surrounding them. What looks like friendly lobbying of committees is actually bias in representation by interest groups and committees.},

abstract = {Electoral systems are commonly treated as exogenous determinants of political party systems, yet our theoretical understanding remains limited as to how these institutions themselves are determined. Part of the problem lies with the subject matter itself: electoral system change is frequently idiosyncratic, often occurring during episodes of exceptional political change. Yet another aspect of the problem is that explanations of electoral system change frequently occur piecemeal in application to specific cases, without systematic or comparative development. Addressing both problems, I first survey the existing literature to develop a comprehensive typology of explanations of electoral system change and persistence. I then set forth a theory predicting the conditions under which electoral systems should change, linking motivations for institutional change to instrumentally rational political parties seeking to maximize their legislative seat shares. The theory predicts that electoral laws will change when a coalition of parties exists such that each party in the coalition expects to gain more seats under an alternative electoral institution, and that also has sufficient power to effect this alternative through fiat given the rules for changing electoral laws. To contrast this model to other explanations of electoral system change, I point to its observable implications and outline how it could be confirmed or disconfirmed in empirical research. The comparison also highlights limitations in other approaches to explaining electoral system change, and underscores the importance of institutions in inducing equilibriums in both electoral systems and party systems. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior to this development, party leaders could only make educated guesses about public opinion. These guesses, however, were often incorrect, since they were based on unsystematic evidence. But armed with polls, parties should avoid such errors, approximating Downs' (1957) assumption of certainty. If so, rational parties should converge near the center of the distribution of public opinion. Or in other words, parties should no longer polarize on highly salient issues that confront the nation. This conclusion has important implications for the study of partisan realignments. The best work on the subject by scholars like Sundquist (1983) and Carmines and Stimson (1989) argue that one requirement for a realignment is that the parties must polarize on an issue of high salience to the public. Yet well-informed, rational parties should not engage in such behavior, suggesting that critical realignments may be things of the past. Note that partisan change still occurs--perhaps along the lines of Key's (1959) notion of secular realignment or Carmines' and Stimson's (1989) concept of "issue evolution."},

Accordingly, the logic suggests that empirical analysis should incorporate these incentives.

@article{Denzau1986,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper derives a supply price for public policy using a constrained maximization model. In the model, three sets of agents each have preferences over outcomes: organized interest groups offer campaign contributions to improve their own wealth, voters offer votes to obtain outcomes closer to their most preferred outcomes, and legislators seek both campaign contributions and votes to obtain reelection. A given legislator's supply price for policy is shown to depend on the productivity of his effort, as determined by committee assignments, priority and ability, and by the preferences of his unorganized constituency in the home district. Two extreme assumptions about the effectiveness of campaign spending in eliciting votes are used to illustrate the comparative statics properties of the model. The prediction of the model is that interest groups will, in general, seek out legislators whose voters are indifferent to the policy the interest group seeks. Thus, voters who do have preferences over policy are in effect represented, even though they are not organized.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We document the scope and consequences of affective polarization of partisans using implicit, explicit, and behavioral indicators. Our evidence demonstrates that hostile feelings for the opposing party are ingrained or automatic in voters' minds, and that affective polarization based on party is just as strong as polarization based on race. We further show that party cues exert powerful effects on nonpolitical judgments and behaviors. Partisans discriminate against opposing partisans, doing so to a degree that exceeds discrimination based on race.We note that the willingness of partisans to display open animus for opposing partisans can be attributed to the absence of norms governing the expression of negative sentiment and that increased partisan affect provides an incentive for elites to engage in confrontation rather than cooperation.},

Only on environmental and gun control issues do we find significant evidence of issue evolution, including a linkage between elite and mass opinion. We conclude that culture war issues may not be as prone to issue evolu- tion as previous research has indicated, in part because these issues are not all equally salient to the mass public.},

In contrast to the “immutable characteristics” or essentialist approach, we argue that race should be operationalized as a “bundle of sticks” that can be disaggregated into elements. With elements of race, causal claims may be possible using two designs: (1) studies that measure the effect of exposure to a racial cue and (2) studies that exploit within-group variation to measure the effect of some manipulable element.

abstract = {Schohrs often assert that public support for judicial authority induces Congress to grant resources and discretion to the Supreme Court. However, the theory of competing public agency embraced by the Constitution suggests that public support for courts cannot, by itself explain congressional support for judicial authority. Instead, the logic of the separation of powers system indicates that legislative support for the institutional capacity of courts will be a function of public confidence in the legislature as well as evaluations of the judiciary. We test this theory, finding that public confidence in both Congress and the Court significantly affect congressional support for the Supreme Court, controlling for the ideological distance between the Court and Congress as well as the Court's workload. The results offer a more refined and complex view of the role of public sentiment in balancing institutional power in American politics.},

The paper's observations are drawn from the author's travels with seventeen U.S. House members while they were working in their districts. Member perceptions of their constituency are divided into the geographical, the reelection, the primary and the personal constituencies. Attention is then given to the home style of House members. Home style is treated as an amalgam of three elements – allocation of resources, presentation of self, explanation of Washington activity. An effort is made to relate home style to the various perceived constituencies. Some observations are made relating constituency-oriented research to the existing literature on representation.},

Since racial differences in attitudes toward the Court are so great, we focus here only on the attitudes of white U.S. citizens. Our purposes are both substantive and methodological. On the substantive front, we examine changes in the etiology of support. We investigate the traditional explanations of diffuse support, but, more important, we introduce and evaluate the power of a new set of variables, political values. These political values do an uncommonly good job of predicting attitudes toward the Court. In addition, we devote particular attention to the important role of "opinion leaders" as supporters of the Court. These leaders relate to the Court in a fashion very different from that of the mass public. On the methodological front, we offer an alternative means of thinking about and capturing diffuse support for the Court among the mass public.

The evidence presented in this paper shows that racial attitudes had very little influence on party identification among either younger or older whites.

His "political time" thesis has been particularly influential, revealing how presidents reckon with the work of their predecessors, situate their power within recent political events, and assert their authority in the service of change. In the original edition of this book, Skowronek revisited that thesis to make better sense of the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. In this new edition, he also addresses the first two years of Barack Obama's presidency.Already considered a classic and widely used in courses on the presidency, Skowronek's book has greatly expanded our understanding of and debates over the politics of leadership. It clarifies the typical political problems that presidents confront in political time, as well as the likely effects of their working through them, and considers contemporary innovations in our political system that bear on the leadership patterns from the more distant past. Drawing out parallels in the politics of leadership between Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt and between James Polk and John Kennedy, it develops a new and revealing perspective on the presidential leadership of Clinton, Bush, and now Obama.In this edition, Skowronek devotes an entirely new chapter to Obama's presidency and its prospects for becoming transformational-like the presidencies of Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, FDR, and Reagan, all of whom succeeded to varying degrees in reconstructing the playing field of national politics. Along the way, he wonders if this kind of leadership is still even possible, given the current divided state of the American polity. He also takes a fresh look at the impact of the twenty-four-hour news cycle, of a more disciplined and homogeneous Republican party, of conservative advocacy of the "unitary theory" of the executive, and of progressive disillusionment with the presidency as an institution.A provocative review of presidential history, Skowronek's book brims with fresh insights and opens a window on the institution of the executive office and the workings of the American political system as a whole. Intellectually satisfying for scholars, it also provides an accessible volume for students and general readers interested in the American presidency.},

We evaluate our organizational balancing thesis using data on executive branch general revenue fund forecasts in the American states from 1987 to 2002. States with a combination of politically appointed agency executives and merit-selected subordinates generally provide more accurate revenue forecasts than states that possess uniformly politicized personnel selection systems. Conversely, states with a combination of department head–appointed executives and subordinates chosen from an at-will system (i.e., nonmerit) produce more accurate forecasts than states with uniformly autonomous personnel selection systems.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}While rational choice models of Supreme Court decisionmaking have enhanced our appreciation for the separation of powers built into the Madisonian Constitutional design, convincing empirical support for a Separation-of-Powers (SOP) constraint on justices' behavior has been elusive. We apply a standard spatial voting model to identify circumstances in which Attitudinalist and SOP predictions about justices' behavior diverge. Our reconsideration of the theory indicates that prior efforts to test quantitatively the two models have failed to select out cases for which the two models' predictions do not differ. While our more focused test offers a fairer test of the SOP constraint, the results strongly reject the SOP model. Nonetheless, our analysis provides leverage on this issue by: (1) delineating and executing necessary research design protocols for crafting a critical test of the SOP model; and (2) rejecting the two exogenously fixed alternative SOP models and suggesting avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Given that democratization is an ongoing, dynamic process, what explains the emergence and maintenance of some types of political institutions and the decline of others? The answer, we argue, lies not in the intentional design of long-run constittuional principles but rather in the short-run strategic choices of political actors. While many would agree with this vision as applied to legislative or executive institutions, we claim that it is equally applicable to courts. After laying out our argument--a theory of institutional emergence and maintenance--in some detail, we test it by applying gmae theory to a critical moment in American history: the defining sequence of events for American presidential-court relations that played out between President Thomas Jefferson and Chief Justice John Marshall in the early 1800s. Our analysis allows us to assess factors fundamental to most explanations of the Jefferson-Marshall conflict: the political and institutional preference of the actors (especially Jefferson's preferences over judicial review) and the larger political environment in which the conflict took place. It also provides important insights into how we might study other interinstitutional interactions, be they of historical moment or of future concern.},

However, we also show that an executive will sometimes face electoral incentives to enact a policy that is both unpopular and contrary to voters' interests.

We contend that political conditions at the time of enactment—in particular, the existence of divided government and the level of ideological disagreement between the House and Senate—influence the likelihood that a law will be amended. We demonstrate that laws originally crafted by diverse political coalitions are less durable than those crafted by strong, unified coalitions, which are in a position to entrench their preferred policies and protect them from future change.

MCs have three goals: Re-election, power in Congress, and good public policy (p 137; see also Fenno 1977). This book is about how members adopt a "home style" to help them secure the first goal (re-election), which in turn makes attainment of the other goals possible.

Our findings underscore doubts that policymakers perceive public opinion accurately: we show that politi- cians maintain systematic misperceptions about their constituents' views, typically erring by over 10 percentage points, and that entire groups of politicians maintain even more severe collective misperceptions. A second post-election survey finds that the electoral process fails to correct these misperceptions. Speaking to debates left unresolved since Miller and Stokes (1963), these findings suggest that collective representation, the electoral process, and the rise of opinion polls do not ameliorate legislators' difficulty gauging constituent opinion.

Are the party-centered elections of the past better for democratic politics than the candidate-centered elections of the present? In this landmark book, John Aldrich goes beyond the clamor of arguments over whether American political parties are in resurgence or decline and undertakes a wholesale reexamination of the foundations of the American party system. Surveying three critical episodes in the development of American political parties-from their formation in the 1790s to the Civil War-Aldrich shows how parties serve to combat three fundamental problems of democracy: how to regulate the number of people seeking public office; how to mobilize voters; and how to achieve and maintain the majorities needed to accomplish goals once in office. Overcoming these obstacles, argues Aldrich, is possible only with political parties. Aldrich brings this innovative account up to date by looking at the profound changes in the character of political parties since World War II. In the 1960s, he shows, parties started to become candidate-centered organizations that are servants to their office seekers and officeholders. Aldrich argues that this development has revitalized parties, making them stronger, and more vital, with well-defined cleavages and highly effective governing ability.},

Two mechanisms of policy responsiveness are (1) elections change the government's political composition, which is then reflected in new policy and (2) policymakers calculate future (mainly electoral) implications of current public views and act accordingly (rational anticipation). We develop multiple indicators of policy activity for the House, Senate, presidency, and Supreme Court, then model policy liberalism as a joint function of the two mechanisms. For each institution separately, and also in a global analysis of “government as a whole,” we find that policy responds dynamically to public opinion change.

abstract = {The foundation upon which accounts of policy-motivated behavior of Supreme Court justices are built consists of assumptions about the policy preferences of the justices. To date, most scholars have assumed that the policy positions of Supreme Court justices remain consistent throughout the course of their careers and most measures of judicial ideology—such as Segal and Cover scores—are time invariant. On its face, this assumption is reasonable; Supreme Court justices serve with life tenure and are typically appointed after serving in other political or judicial roles. However, it is also possible that the worldviews, and thus the policy positions, of justices evolve through the course of their careers. In this article we use a Bayesian dynamic ideal point model to investigate preference change on the US Supreme Court. The model allows for justices' ideal points to change over time in a smooth fashion. We focus our attention on the 16 justices who served for 10 or more terms and completed their service between the 1937 and 2003 terms. The results are striking—14 of these 16 justices exhibit significant preference change. This has profound implications for the use of time-invariant preference measures in applied work.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract This is a highly selective review of the huge literature bearing on the capacity of mass electorates for issue voting, in view of the great (mal)distribution of political information across the public, with special attention to the implications of information heterogeneity for alternative methods of research. I trace the twists and turns in understanding the meaning of high levels of response instability on survey policy items from their discovery in the first panel studies of 1940 to the current day. I consider the recent great elaboration of diverse heuristics that voters use to reason with limited information, as well as evidence that the aggregation of preferences so central to democratic process serves to improve the apparent quality of the electoral response. A few recent innovations in design and analysis hold promise of illuminating this topic from helpful new angles. Never overestimate the information of the American electorate, but never underestimate its intelligence. (Mark Shields, ...},

abstract = {Competitive elections create a relationship of formal accountability between policy makers and citizens. Recent theoretical work suggests that there are limits on how well this formal accountability links policy decisions to citizen preferences. In particular, incumbents' incentives are driven not by the voters' evaluation of the normative desirability of outcomes but by the outcome's information about the incumbent's type (e.g., competence or ideology). This review surveys both this body of theory and the robust empirical literature it has spawned. It concludes with a short discussion of ongoing work that attempts to integrate this theoretical perspective with a richer view of policy-making institutions.},
annote = {Ashworth (2012) presents a formal model in which representatives should be more
responsive when the benefit to being reelected increases. Indeed, representatives subject to reelection go back to the district more often, employ a larger staff, attend roll-call votes more often, and introduce more legislation (Herrick, Moore, and Hibbing, 1994). Past research has also found, however, that representatives do not change their voting behavior when they are not subject to reelection (Zupan, 1990). Moreover, representatives who are not running for reelection are less likely to introduce frivolous legislation and more likely to have a tightly focused legislative agenda (Herrick, Moore, and Hibbing, 1994). This discrepancy could arise from reputational concerns: representatives may not change their behavior when reelection is no longer a factor because they wish to preserve their legacy and have a positive reputation after leaving office. They may worry that changing their votes on issues could tarnish that legacy. These legislators could also have a tightly focused legislative agenda because they focus more time and resources on their preferred policy areas, rather than policy areas more relevant to their district. I would be curious to test two other possible outcomes of representatives no longer being concerned with reelection. First, do these representatives change their fundraising behavior? They should be more likely to spend less time on fundraising in general, or perhaps spend more time on fundraising for other representatives. Second, are representatives more likely to criticize the party, or party policies, when reelection is no longer a concern? Parties may have less control over representatives not subject to reelection. Reading},

To answer this question, we first develop a strategy to control for the justices' attitudinal change that stems from the social forces that influence public opinion. We then propose a theoretical argument that predicts strategic justices should be mindful of public opinion even in cases when the public is unlikely to be aware of the Court's activities. The results suggest that the influence of public opinion on Supreme Court decisions is real, substantively important, and most pronounced in nonsalient cases.},

Opinion vagueness can reflect efforts to resolve core tradeoffs associated with judicial policymaking that bear some resemblance to standard accounts of political delegation. Vagueness offers judges the ability to manage their uncertainty over policy outcomes and to hide likely defiance from public view. At the same time, vagueness removes a central source of pressure for compliance that judges can place on other policy makers. Using a game-theoretic model, we identify conditions under which judges use vagueness precisely as legislatures use statutory discretion.We also demonstrate conditions under which judges use vagueness in ways unanticipated by standard delegation accounts.},

The theory looks to the evolution of new issues as the stimulus of partisan change and to the continuous replacement of the electorate as the mechanism through which such change is effected.

This approach is extremely flexible, applicable to any legislative setting, irrespective of size, the extremism of the legislators' voting histories, or the number of roll calls available for analysis. The model is easily extended to let other sources of information inform the analysis of roll call data, such as the number and nature of the underlying dimensions, the presence of party whipping, the determinants of legislator preferences, and the evolution of the legislative agenda; this is especially helpful since generally it is inappropriate to use estimates of extant methods (usually generated under assumptions of sincere voting) to test models embodying alternate assumptions (e.g., log-rolling, party discipline). A Bayesian approach also provides a coherent framework for estimation and inference with roll call data that eludes extant methods; moreover, via Bayesian simulation methods, it is straightforward to generate uncertainty assessments or hypothesis tests concerning any auxiliary quantity of interest or to formally compare models. In a series of examples we show how our method is easily extended to accommodate theoretically interesting models of legislative behavior. Our goal is to provide a statistical framework for combining the measurement of legislative preferences with tests of models of legislative behavior.},

We investigate the Court's ability to win popular support for its rulings, specifically in the case of Roe v. Wade. The analysis shows that the Court's decision did affect public attitudes but not as previous work would predict. While support for abortions to protect health increased as a result of the Court's decision, the public became more polarized over "discretionary" abortions. The puzzle is what process can account for these disparate reactions. We develop a theory resting on interpersonal influences to explain these results, arguing that the social interpretation of events drives the differing outcomes. This theory is then tested against a purely psychological alternative.

This revised and expanded edition includes two new chapters on the political economy of the Obama era. One presents the Great Recession as a "stress test" of the American political system by analyzing the 2008 election and the impact of Barack Obama's “New New Deal” on the economic fortunes of the rich, middle class, and poor. The other assesses the politics of inequality in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2012 election, and the partisan gridlock of Obama's second term. Larry Bartels offers a sobering account of the barriers to change posed by partisan ideologies and the political power of the wealthy. He also provides new analyses of tax policy, partisan differences in economic performance, the struggle to raise the minimum wage, and inequalities in congressional representation.

President Obama identified inequality as “the defining challenge of our time.” Unequal Democracy is the definitive account of how and why our political system has failed to rise to that challenge. Now more than ever, this is a book every American needs to read.

And yet this article does just that because research conducted by scholars (mostly outside of political science) has demonstrated that the policy goal is not the only motivation; it may not even be dominant for many judges. The evidence is now so strong that it poses a serious challenge to the extremely (un)realist(ic) conception of judicial behavior that has dominated the study of law and legal institutions for generations. In addition to reviewing this evidence, we offer a more realistic conception of judicial motivations and suggest how different approaches to the study of courts can contribute to this new avenue of research.},
annote = {Epstein and Knight book notes: offer a plethora of anecdotes and summary statistics about judicial decision making. It is informative about how the supreme court makes decisions, but does nothing to resolve dominant models of decision making. Few of their examples or data are not equally plausible outcomes of different theories of decision-making. 


Their argument that judges are rational actors if frequency assumed. Each section takes the general form: 
“a [rational] justice would have no reason not to [act rationally]” where the act is something judges are well known to do frequently. “How common is this? It is common.” Thus, the data show that judges are rational actors.


This logic does little to discriminate between observationally equivalent outcomes plausibly due to any number of different theories of judicial behavior. 


Rational choices are understood to be sophisticated and frequently change. Quotes from internal memos suggest these changes are made in light of information about the preferences of others. Do these memos lack reasonings and arguments? The authors never entertain the notion that justices may be convinced. 


In addition to new preferences, new choices are often introduced/invented. In this context, how are we to understand rational action related to stable preferences on issues that are entirely new. Can a justice have fixed preferences relative to an issues one has never thought about. For example, in the case used to introduce the argument, the NAACP amicus brief suggested a new potential standard of review. Epstein and Knight first use the positions announced by justices at the cert hearing as evidence of original positions / sincere preferences. They take the change from these ‘original.sincere' preferences to the NAACP standard as strategic accommodation to form a majority. However, they later note how these statements are ambiguous and may be strategic. All of this is taken to be evidence that judges are strategic actors. Unfortunately, Epstein and Knight fail to escape from the tautology of preferences and actions. 


They use the same example to illustrate why a justice may select an outcome other than her most preferred when her most preferred is in the minority. Justices may settle on some middle ground or set the issue aside by ruling on a different issue. However, in order for the example to illustrate their point, at least one justice must be assumed to prioritize jurisprudence over policy. If judges can rationally prefer jurisprudence as their top preference, and it is not merely a restrain imposed by the need to maintain legitimacy (as they suggest), then what does it mean to say judges are rational? 


They discuss at length the strategic reasons for one justice to make suggestions others, including to author of the opinion when one is deserting (pg93), but the rational for the opinion writer to grant the request is simply “giving Brennan a small victory in a case otherwise decided against his interests.” Why? 


Ultimately, with every page introducing a new layer of external or internal context which might change what is strategic, the level of sophisticated decision-making, writing, learning, bargaining, seems impossible to model as a game. 


There is much emphasis on how much judges will sacrifice to assemble a majority opinion and thus establish the ‘law of the land,” which implies that law matters. 


Efforts toward moderation and unanimity are characterized as aimed at reducing substantive backlash from “external political actors.” But if this is the end, what good does a unanimous decisions in Brown v. Board do over a 5-4? 


The authors concede significant ground on the use of a rational choice framework. Judges lack key information and sometimes prefer legal principles to material policy victories, choice spaces change in the course of deliberation and innovative reasoning, and decision-making context is “shaped by rules, norms, and conventions,” which are uncertain and also change over time. 


Interesting events are shoe-horned into the rational choice framework. A mild dissenting rebuke is considered a “sanction” for violating an informal norm of the court and thus explaining why we have not seen the norm violated since. (120)


While there was clearly gaming on behalf of Burger in Roe, Notes on 130 look much more like persuasion and reserved judgement than gaming.},

Second, the monthly volume of presidential remarks on Court cases is shaped to varying degrees by presidents' desires to bolster their reelections, policy goals, and historical legacies. By shedding new light on why presidents comment publicly on Supreme Court cases, this research contributes to our understanding of presidential speechmaking, executive-judicial branch interactions, and how norms and institutions shape the behavior of political actors.

The line of research in political theory followed during the last generation has involved seeking an equilibrium of tastes; but it has revealed that such an equilibrium exists only rarely, if at all.

The recent increase in the stability of Court membership has raised questions about the continued efficiacy of the replacement mechanism and renewed debates over mechanisms to limit judicial tenure. Our analysis provides little evidence that justices respond strategically public opinion but provides partial support for the idea that justices' preferences shift in response to the same social forces that shape the opinions of thegeneral public.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Vote-specific parameters are often by-products of roll call analysis, the primary goal being the measurement of legislators' ideal points. But these vote-specific parameters are more important in higher-dimensional settings: prior restrictions on vote parameters help identify the model, and researchers often have prior beliefs about the nature of the dimensions underlying the proposal space. Bayesian methods provide a straightforward and rigorous way for incorporating these prior beliefs into roll call analysis. I demonstrate this by exploiting the close connections among roll call analysis, item-response models, and “full-information” factor analysis. Vote-specific discrimination parameters are equivalent to factor loadings, and as in factor analysis, they (1) enable researchers to discern the substantive content of the recovered dimensions, (2) can be used for assessing dimensionality and model checking, and (3) are an obvious vehicle for introducing and testing researchers' prior beliefs about the dimensions. Bayesian simulation facilitates these uses of discrimination parameters, by simplifying estimation and inference for the massive number of parameters generated by roll call analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Scholars have argued that the lack of majority control in the Senate (e.g., filibuster and open amendment procedure), which is the driving force behind party theories in the House, work against the prospect of party effect in the Senate. Moreover, senate rules provide more power to the autonomous member enabling them to resist party pressures. Yet the authors argue that whereas the institutional difference between the House and Senate probably influence the degree and strength of the party effect in the Senate, (parties are stronger in the House), parties are still crucial and important in the Senate. (8). They argue that re-election, policy and office goal will motivate senators to allow party effect in the Senate (10-12). Thus, for example committee chairmenship is still in the hands of the party, which can take away disloyal chairmen. The various chapters in the book (which examine motives of Senators to allow party effect in the senate, party effect in voting behavior, rules and procedures and their ability to enhance party effects (the Whip, committee system, filibuster) and the effect of parties on policy outcomes), ``present a strong case for party effects in the U.S Senate'' (17).},

We first overcome the problem of irregular and infrequent measurement of attitudes toward the Supreme Court by employing an approach developed by Stimson (1991) which allows us to pool seventeen similar survey items administered a total of ninety-three times to produce a single, semi-annual time series of support for the Supreme Court, extending from 1973 through 1993. We then consider the effect of the Court's ideological position on the level of support it enjoys. In contrast to previous research, we take into account that both the Court's and the public's ideological preferences vary over time. Our analysis indicates that the public's appraisal of the Supreme Court responds not to the Court's ideological position per se, but rather to the extent to which the Court's position diverges from the ideological preferences of the citizenry; when the Court deviates from the public mood, its support erodes.},

In this article, using a comprehensive data set spanning 1953 to 2001, several strategic communication tactics through which the president might influence temporary opinion movement are examined. Findings show that presidential use of nationally televised addresses is the most consistently effective strategy to enhance presidential leadership, but the effect is lessened for later serving presidents. Strategies involving domestic travel never positively affect leadership, while televised interactions with the media always negatively affect leadership success. The cumulative results imply that presidents can momentarily lead public opinion with particular tactics and that the conditions enhancing leadership are partially in their control, suggesting presidential capability to strategically lead public opinion.},

abstract = {The recent increase in partisan media has generated interest in whether such outlets polarize viewers. I draw on theories of motivated reasoning to explain why partisan media polarize viewers, why these programs affect some viewers much more strongly than others, and how long these effects endure. Using a series of original experiments, I find strong support for my theoretical expectations, including the argument that these effects can still be detected several days postexposure. My results demonstrate that partisan media polarize the electorate by taking relatively extreme citizens and making them even more extreme. Though only a narrow segment of the public watches partisan media programs, partisan media's effects extend much more broadly throughout the political arena.},

abstract = {Policy makers in democracies have strong partisan and electoral in- centives regarding the amount, nature, and timing of economic-policy activity. Given these incentives, many observers expected government control of effective economic policies to induce clear economic-outcome cycles that track the electoral calendar in timing and incumbent partisanship in character. Empirics, however, typically revealed stronger evidence of partisan than of electoral shifts in real economic performance and stronger and more persistent electoral and partisan shifts in certain fiscal, monetary, and other policies than in real outcomes. Later political-economic general-equilibrium ap- proaches incorporated rational expectations into citizens' and policymakers' economic and political behavior to explain much of this empirical pattern, yet critical anoma- lies and insufficiencies remain. Moreover, until recently, both rational- and adaptive- expectations electoral-and-partisan-cycle work underemphasized crucial variation in the contexts—international and domestic, political and economic, institutional, struc- tural, and strategic—in which elected partisan incumbentsmake policy. This contextual variation conditions policy-maker incentives and abilities to manipulate economic pol- icy for electoral and partisan gain, as well as the effectiveness of such manipulation, differently across democracies, elections, and policies. Although relatively new, re- search into such context-conditional electoral and partisan cycles seems to offer much promise for resolving anomalies and an ideal substantive venue for theoretical and empirical advancement in the study of political economy and comparative democratic politics more generally.},

We propose studying such situations with an “opinion contest” framework and use new data on Supreme Court nominations to contrast the political capital and opinion contest approaches. From 1930 to 2009 presidents went public over Supreme Court nominees primarily when groups mobilized against the nominee. Republican presidents did so particularly when their nominee would move the Supreme Court's median to the right. When going public, presidents typically engaged in “crafted talk.” Finally, going public was associated with more negative votes in the Senate, not fewer, because presidents went public over Supreme Court nominees only when battling an active opposition.},

A number of recent studies examine the traditional hypothesis that the electoral fortunes of the incumbent president's party rise and fall in direct relation to fluctua-tions in the state of the national economy. Typically these studies employ a longitudi-nal design in which a party's aggregate congressional vote serves as the dependent variable, and various economic indicators serve as independent variables. On balance. the election returns appear to bear some relation to economic conditions, although various disagreements exist. Using data from the 1956 to 1974 SRC election studies this paper attempts to uncover an individual-level basis for the macro-relationship found by earlier studies. Specifically, do citizens vote for or against the incumbent president's party as a function of their personal economic condition? The survey data permit us to conclude that a citizen's personal economic condition affects his presi-dential vote. For congressional voting, however, the findings are positive until 1960 and negative thereafter. And contrary to some previous research, we find no system-atic relationship between a citizen's personal economic condition and his decision to vote or abstain.},

My analysis em- ploys panel data to isolate the impact of partisan bias in the context of a Bayesian model of opinion change; I also present more straightforward evidence of contrasts in Democrats' and Republicans' perceptions of "objective" politically relevant events. I conclude that partisan bias in political perceptions plays a crucial role in perpetuating and reinforcing sharp differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans. This conclusion handsomely validates the emphasis placed by the authors of The Amer- ican Voter on "the role of enduring partisan commitments in shaping attitudes toward political objects."},

Using a probit model of agency implementation of Court opinions from the 1953 through 1990 terms, I also demonstrate that several factors explain whether agencies comply, including the nature of the Court's opinions. the characteristics of the responding agency, and support by societal interests. I further il- lustrate that the absence of defiance or evasion most likely results from the interdependencies between federal agencies and the Court.

abstract = {From Louis Brandeis to Robert Bork to Clarence Thomas, the nomination of federal judges has generated intense political conflict. With the coming retirement of one or more Supreme Court Justices--and threats to filibuster lower court judges--the selection process is likely to be, once again, the center of red-hot partisan debate. In Advice and Consent, two leading legal scholars, Lee Epstein and Jeffrey A. Segal, offer a brief, illuminating Baedeker to this highly important procedure, discussing everything from constitutional background, to crucial differences in the nomination of judges and justices, to the role of the Judiciary Committee in vetting nominees. Epstein and Segal shed light on the role played by the media, by the American Bar Association, and by special interest groups (whose efforts helped defeat Judge Bork). Though it is often assumed that political clashes over nominees are a new phenomenon, the authors argue that the appointment of justices and judges has always been a highly contentious process--one largely driven by ideological and partisan concerns. The reader discovers how presidents and the senate have tried to remake the bench, ranging from FDR's controversial "court packing" scheme to the Senate's creation in 1978 of 35 new appellate and 117 district court judgeships, allowing the Democrats to shape the judiciary for years. The authors conclude with possible "reforms," from the so-called nuclear option, whereby a majority of the Senate could vote to prohibit filibusters, to the even more dramatic suggestion that Congress eliminate a judge's life tenure either by term limits or compulsory retirement. With key appointments looming on the horizon, Advice and Consent provides everything concerned citizens need to know to understand the partisan rows that surround the judicial nominating process.},

Although qualitative evidence shows that slavery has been a key factor behind the prevalence of violence, especially in South USA (Cash, 1941; Franklin, 1956; Gastil, 1971; Wyatt-Brown, 1986), no empirical evidence supports this claim so far. I propose that the proportion of slaves in a certain county in 1860 is positively correlated with the rate of violent crimes in 2000. As violence was extensively used to control slaves for hundreds of years, a culture of violence was formed and persisted through time. Extending Engermann and Sokoloff's hypotheses (1997; 2002), I empirically examine two hypotheses: (1) slavery has a long-term effect on violent crime. (2) Such long-term effect is mainly transmitted through inequality. The results show that slavery in 1860 is positively associated with violent crime in 2000. Testing the second hypothesis, I find that land inequality in 1860 has a long-term significant effect on contemporary violent crime.},

Two new national surveys address the measurement problem directly by asking respondents how they would vote and how they think their representatives voted on key roll-call votes. Using the actual votes, we can, in turn, construct instrumental variables that correct for simultaneity. We find that the American electorate responds strongly to substantive representation.

abstract = {What are the primary factions within the Democratic and Republican parties, and to what extent do rival factions cooperate? We address these questions using a unique data set of information sharing between party organizations, media outlets, 527s, and interest groups. Using social network methods, we identify two major information-sharing clusters, or expanded party networks; these networks correspond to a liberal/Democratic grouping and a conserva-tive/Republican grouping. We further identify factions within each party network, but we find a high degree of cooperation between party factions. That is, our data suggest that beneath the intraparty disagreements we observe in primary elections and policy debates there is a subterranean pat-tern of organizational cooperation. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. —James Madison (1787)},

The results indicate that judicial ideology significantly affects bureaucratic decision making. Specifically, a standard deviation increase in the liberalism of the lower courts decreases the probability that the Corps will grant a permit by 14{\%}, which is comparable to the effects of long-recognized determinants of administrative behavior.},

@article{Mummolo2017,
abstract = {Social divisions between American partisans are growing, with Republicans and Democrats exhibiting homophily in a range of seemingly nonpolitical domains. It has been widely claimed that this partisan social divide extends to Amer-icans' decisions about where to live. In two original survey experiments, we confirm that Democrats are, in fact, more likely than Republicans to prefer living in more Democratic, dense, and racially diverse places. However, improving on previous studies, we test respondents' stated preferences against their actual moving behavior. While partisans differ in their residential preferences, on average they are not migrating to more politically distinct communities. Using zip-code-level census and partisanship data on the places where respondents live, we provide one explanation for this contra-diction: by prioritizing common concerns when deciding where to live, Americans forgo the opportunity to move to more politically compatible communities. A mericans appear to be more socially divided along partisan lines than ever before. On surveys, partisans have expressed increasingly negative judgments to-ward members of the opposite party (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012; Iyengar and Westwood 2015; Malhotra, Margalit, and Levendusky 2015). Partisanship now appears to be an important social identity, on par with race and gender, that shapes everything from media consumption preferences (Iyen-gar and Hahn 2009; Levendusky 2009; Prior 2007) to selec-tion of mates (Alford et al. 2011; Huber and Malhotra 2012; Iyengar et al. 2012). Both explicit and implicit discrimina-tion measures indicate that disdain for the opposite party pervades Americans' attitudes and social interactions. The strong form of such claims is that, given the opportunity, partisans can be expected to actively avoid or punish mem-bers of the other party in their day-to-day lives. The weaker and more prevalent version of such claims suggests that an array of racial, socioeconomic, and cultural differences be-tween the two parties leads them to adopt different behaviors, with partisanship lurking in the background. Regardless of the reason for their social divisions, the sorting of Ameri-cans into more homogeneous social networks is a special cause for concern. If Americans isolate themselves from the other party, they may end up living in homogeneous political milieus that breed political extremism (Klar 2014; Sunstein 2009). In this study, we consider a form of partisan sorting that has been invoked repeatedly as being especially troubling: the alleged tendency of Democrats and Republicans to pre-fer and move to communities that happen to match their pol-itics (Bishop and Cushing 2008; Gimpel and Hui 2015; Pew Research Center 2014; Sussell 2013). If true, the increased residential separation of Democrats and Republicans could have profound practical and normative consequences, includ-ing more polarized metropolitan areas, and could impose substantial effects on elections at several levels of government as districts become increasingly lopsided (McDonald 2011). Such problems may appear even if partisan sorting is a con-sequence of seemingly apolitical decision making. If partisans not only disagree more often with out-party members but are},

@article{Lee2015,
abstract = {The purpose of this review is to take stock of how party polarization affects governance in the United States. The article begins by defining polarization and discussing the means by which it can be measured. It is undeniable that the two parties have grown more sharply differentiated. Some evidence suggests that the substantive policy preferences of liberals and conservatives diverge more widely, but the case for ideological polarization in the spatial sense is not definitive. Effects on the institutional processes of US government have entailed a hardening of party divisions and a tendency toward centralization of power. Nevertheless, these more cohesive parties are not more effective than their predecessors at enacting policies or managing routine governing responsibilities. The consequences for public policy seem best characterized as “drift” (Hacker 2004, p. 246). There is little evidence that party polarization has promoted ideologically extreme policy outcomes or had systematically advantaged either liberalism or conservatism.},

@article{Aldrich2015,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Duverger's Law suggests that two parties will dominate under first-past-the-post (FPTP) within an electoral district, but the law does not necessarily establish two-party competition at the national level. United States is unique among FPTP countries in having the only durable and nearly pure, two-party system. Following this observation, we answer two questions. First, what contributes to the same two parties competing in districts all across the country and at different levels of office? Second, why is the US two-party system so durable over time, dominated by the same two parties? That is, “Why two parties?” As an answer, we propose the APP: ambition, the presidency, and policy. The presidency with its national electorate and electoral rules that favor two-party competition establishes two national major parties, which frames the opportunity structure that influences party affiliation decisions of ambitious politicians running for lower offices. Control over the policy agenda helps reinforce the continuation of a particular two-party system in equilibrium by blocking third parties through divergence on the main issue dimension and the suppression of latent issue dimensions that could benefit new parties. The confluence of the three factors explains why the United States is so uniquely a durable two-party system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

When holding preferred assignments, legislators are free to focus on legislative activity in Washington, DC. But when the subsidy is removed, legislators are forced to direct attention to the district. To test our theory of legislative subsidy, we exploit committee exile---the involuntary removal of committee members after a party loses a sizable number of seats. Legislators are selected for exile using members' rank on the committee, causing exiled and remaining legislators to appear strikingly similar. Using exile, we show that it has only limited electoral consequences, but this is partly due to compensatory efforts. Exiled legislators shift attention away from Washington and towards the district: they raise and spend more money for reelection, author less legislation, are absent for more days of voting, and vote with their party less often.},

Much of this work has been hampered, however, by the relative rarity of such events; as has long been noted, congressional attention to the Court is limited, and most Court decisions represent the last word on statutory interpretation. With this fact foremost in our minds, we examine empirically a number of theories regarding such reversals. By adopting an approach that allows us to separate the factors that lead to the event itself (that is, the presence or absence of an override in a particular case) from those that influence the timing of the event, we find that case-specific factors are an important influence in the incidence of overrides, whereas Congress- and Court-specific political influences dominate the timing at which those overrides occur. By separating the incidence and timing of overrides, our study yields a more accurate and nuanced understanding of this aspect of the separation-of-powers system.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

These discrepancies are important for two reasons. First, as I show, receiving poor ABA ratings is correlated with confirmation failure. Second, I demonstrate that ABA ratings do not actually predict whether judges will be "better" in terms of reversal rates.

The Constrained Court combines new theoretical insights and extensive data analysis to show that law and politics together shape the behavior of justices on the Supreme Court. Michael Bailey and Forrest Maltzman show how two types of constraints have influenced the decision making of the modern Court. First, Bailey and Maltzman document that important legal doctrines, such as respect for precedents, have influenced every justice since 1950. The authors find considerable variation in how these doctrines affect each justice, variation due in part to the differing experiences justices have brought to the bench. Second, Bailey and Maltzman show that justices are constrained by political factors. Justices are not isolated from what happens in the legislative and executive branches, and instead respond in predictable ways to changes in the preferences of Congress and the president. The Constrained Court shatters the myth that justices are unconstrained actors who pursue their personal policy preferences at all costs. By showing how law and politics interact in the construction of American law, this book sheds new light on the unique role that the Supreme Court plays in the constitutional order.},

The present study employs judicial decisionmaking in the U.S. Courts of Appeals as a window through which to reexamine the politics of selection to the lower courts. It differs from previous studies of selection in three ways. First, it takes advantage of recent innovations in measurement to go beyond reliance on political party as a measure of the preferences of actors in the selection process. Second, employing these new measures it examines the relative effects of the operation of policy and partisan agendas in the selection process. Third, a more complex model of selection is assessed than in most previous studies-one that expressly examines the role of senators and senatorial preferences in the selection process. The results clearly suggest that the politics of selection differ dramatically depending upon whether or not senatorial courtesy is in operation, The voting behavior of Courts of Appeals judges Selected without senatorial courtesy is consistent with the operation of a presidential policy agenda. Among judges selected when senatorial courtesy is in play, the linkage between presidential preferences and judicial outcomes disappears},

Our nuanced look at the Court's policymaking suggests rational bases for perceiving the Court's contemporary policymaking as conservative, moderate, and even liberal. We argue that subjective ideological disagreement—incongruence between one's ideological preferences and one's perception of the Court's ideological tenor—must be accounted for when explaining legitimacy. Analysis of a national survey shows that subjective ideological disagreement exhibits a potent, deleterious impact on legitimacy. Ideology exhibits sensible connections to legitimacy depending on how people perceive the Court's ideological tenor. Results from a survey experiment support our posited mechanism.

We argue that open nomination systems and the ambitious politicians competing within those systems encourage activists with extreme views on a variety of issue dimensions to become involved in party politics, thus motivating candidates to take noncentrist positions on a range of issues. Once that happens, continuing activists with strong partisan commitments bring their views into line with the new candidate agendas, thus extending the domain of interparty conflict. Using cross-sectional and panel surveys of national convention delegates, we find clear evidence for conflict extension among party activists, evidence tentatively suggesting a leading role for activists in partisan conflict extension more generally, and strong support for our argument about change among continuing activists. Issue conversion among activists has contributed substantially to conflict extension and party commitment has played a key role in motivating that conversion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To test the model, I construct a measure that assesses legislative output in proportion to the policy agenda. Using newspaper editorials to identify every salient legislative issue between 1947 and 1996, I generate Congress-by-Congress gridlock scores and use them to test competing explanations.

Our analytical framework focuses on two key substantive effects of jurisprudential categories on the Court's case outcomes—relative differences between categories over multiple time periods and longitudinal differences across time periods. Importantly, different pieces of empirical evidence can provide support for different dynamic processes. The extent to which “law matters” is not necessarily tied to one particular model of legal change.

{\textperiodcentered}1. Corwin and Huntington are very different that Neustadt and Wildavsky in their approaches and methods. Here, you can clearly see the effects of the shift to behavioral research — not what the rules say or how they developed, but what presidents actually do in order to achieve their goals (or, more properly, what behavior we actually observe, and why). What I want you to think about is the relationship between the questions that the authors ask, and the methods, and how the questions are shaped by the dominant research paradigms. 

Another way to put it – is it possible to envision what Corwin or Huntington might have done (or asked) if they were writing in 1970 (or 2015)? 

2. One criticism of Neustadt (and we might apply more generally to behavioral approaches, although that would be contested) is the lack of a strong normative component in Presidential Power. By advocating a transactional approach to presidential leadership, Neustadt is open to the charge that he's ignoring the ends of presidential leadership. Is it just power and influence? One might level a similar critique of Wildavsky. 

Is this fair? Schlesinger criticized Neustadt for arguing that in a nuclear age, the president had to act without Congress or the Courts in the event of a crisis, that “debate within the executive branch could replace Congress as a means of check and balance in the nuclear age (Imperial Presidency, p. 189). Is there really a link between Neustadt and irresponsible use of power? Is it fair, as Normon Thomas wrote in 1981, that “Neustadt has been likened to a modern Machiavelli”? 

3. Given the uncertainties of executive power (a central element of Corwin), is it realistic to expect anything other than aggressive use of presidential power to fill in the gaps (indeed, this is a major premise of the contemporary unilateral powers literature)?},

Existing research focuses on how the ideological compatibility of the president and the Senate affects the ideology of the president's nominees. However, little work addresses whether presidents can overcome an ideo- logically hostile Senate by spending political capital to support a nominee. As such, we examine the president's public expenditure of capital to obtain confirmation for Supreme Court nominees facing a Senate that is reticent to confirm. By content analyzing public statements made by presidents during confirmation battles we find strong support for the hypothesis that presidents strategically "go public." Further, this strategy has a marked influence on presidents' ability to win confirmation for their most important nominees.},

To examine the role of these proceedings, we ask the following questions: (1) what factors influence the quality of arguments presented to the Court; and, more importantly, (2) does the quality of a lawyer's oral arguments affect the justices' final votes on the merits? We answer these questions by utilizing a unique data source--evaluations Justice Blackmun made of the quality of oral arguments presented to the justices. Our analysis shows that Justice Blackmun's grading of attorneys is somewhat influenced by conventional indicators of the credibility of attorneys and are not simply the product of Justice Blackmun's ideological leanings. We thus suggest they can plausibly be seen as measuring the quality of oral argument. We further show that the probability of a justice voting for a litigant increases dramatically if that litigant's lawyer presents better oral arguments than the competing counsel. These results therefore indicate that this element of the Court's decisional process affects final votes on the merits, and it has implications for how other elite decision makers evaluate and use information.},

This natural experiment allows us to estimate the causal effect of seniority on a variety of career outcomes. Lower ranked committee members are less likely to serve as subcommittee chairs on their initial committee, are more likely to transfer to other committees, and have fewer sponsored bills passed in the jurisdiction of their initial committee.

abstract = {Many of the Supreme Court's most important decisions, such as those involving executive power and the constitutionality of abortion regulations, are decided by plurality decision. Plurality opinions result when five or more Justices agree on the result in a particular case but no single rationale or opinion garners five votes. Many Justices, including William Rehnquist and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, have addressed the problems created by plurality opinions, such as interpretive difficulties in determining the Court's holding, but few scholars have addressed plurality decisions other than in passing. In the first empirical analysis examining the occurrence of plurality decisions, the authors present two statistical models to examine a variety of ideological, collegial, contextual, and legal factors to determine which factors are most likely to lead to plurality decisions. The case-level model draws on data for every Supreme Court case decided between the 1953 and 2006 Terms of the Supreme Court. The results of the study are illuminating. For example, a case is more likely to result in a plurality decision if it involves an issue of constitutional interpretation with respect to a civil liberties issue and lower court conflict did not influence the decision to grant certiorari. Importantly, the empirical results of the case-level model indicate that ideological forces bear no relationship to the occurrence of plurality decisions, and strategic considerations only appear in cases which have a minimum winning coalition. In addition, the authors estimate an individual-Justice model that measures which factors are most likely to lead to votes by Justices to concur in the judgment, which is the key ingredient for a plurality opinion. The opinion author's ideological distance from and prior lack of cooperation with a particular Justice both play a large role in whether the Justice joins the majority and separately concurs or votes to concur in the judgment. Unlike the case-level model, these results show that the Justices' ideological orientations influence their decisions to concur in the judgment. In addition, many of the same factors found influential in the case-level model are also found to influence Justices' decisions to concur in the judgment. Given the importance of plurality decisions to understanding the Supreme Court, this Article provides the basis for further normative evaluations of whether plurality decisions harm the development of the law and how such decisions should be interpreted by lower courts.},

Despite wide acceptance that briefs are important, empirical scholarship has yet to establish their influence on the Supreme Court or fully explore justices' preferences regarding them. We argue that emotional language conveys a lack of credibility to justices and thereby diminishes the party's likelihood of garnering justices' votes. The data concur. Using an automated textual analysis program, we find that parties who employ less emotional language in their briefs are more likely to win a justice's vote, a result that holds even after controlling for other features correlated with success, such as case quality. These findings suggest that advocates seeking to influence judges can enhance their credibility and attract justices' votes by employing measured, objective language.},

Objective conditions pointed to a comfortable victory, if not a landslide, but Gore's narrow popular vote margin fell well below the expectations held by many political scientists. This article attempts to account for Gore's under-performance via detailed analyses of National Election Studies surveys. We find that Gore's often criticized personality was not a cause of his under-performance. Rather, the major cause was his failure to receive a historically normal amount of credit for the performance of the Clinton administration. Secondary contributors were the drag of Clinton's personal affairs and Gore's decision to run to the left of where Clinton had positioned the Democratic party. Quite possibly these three factors are logically related: failure to get normal credit reflected Gore's peculiar campaign, which in turn reflected fear of association with Clinton's behaviour.},

We theorize that Justices are akin to voters in political elections; specifically, we posit that the Justices will view short-term and relatively nit. nor economic downturns-recessions-as attributable to the failures of elected officials, but will consider long-term and extreme economic con tractions-depressions-as the result of exogenous shocks largely beyond the control of the government. Accordingly, we predict two patterns of behavior in economic-related cases that come before the Court: (1) in typical times, when the economy cycles through both recessionary and prosperous periods, the Justices will punish the elected branches of government when the economy contracts by voting less frequently for the government; and (2) in atypical times, when the economy moves into a period of deep depression, the Justices will work with the other branches of government by voting more frequently for the government. We test our hypotheses through statistical analysis of taxation opinions rendered by the Supreme Court during the period from 1913 to 1929 (a relatively normal period) and the period from 1930 to 1940 (the Great Depression). We find broad support for our hypothesis in the data we analyze, and we verify that our results are robust to a change in the measure of the economic condition as well as to a change in the specification of the regression model.

abstract = {Analyzing strategic aspects of judicial decisionmaking is an important element in understanding how law develops. In this article, we examine sophisticated voting on the U.S. Supreme Court by empirically modeling justices' decisions to pass when it is their turn to vote during conference discussions. We argue that, due to the opinion assignment norm, the chief justice may pass when one of the key conditions necessary for sophisticated votingF certainty about the views held by other justices and the agendaF is lacking. By passing, the chief can view his colleagues' votes in order to determine which vote will allow him to assign the majority opinion and, ultimately, forward his policy preferences. Using data from Justice Lewis F. Powell's conference notes, we show that the chief passes for this purpose, and that doing so is an effective strategy. In addition, we show that the senior associate justice in a case, who has a non-trivial chance of assigning the majority opinion, also passes for strategic rea-sons. As we expect, the data indicate that the remaining associates seem not to pass for strategic purposes.},

Few systematic studies yield unambiguous evidence that the adjoining branches of government reliably support elements of the president's domestic or foreign policy agendas during war that they otherwise would oppose. And no one, to date, has offered a clear theory explaining why either Congress or the courts would behave in this way.

This article proposes that the confusion arises from the manner in which the cases were studied, not from the decisions themselves. A legal model with variables that measure the prior justification of the search, the nature of the intrusion, and a few mitigating circumstances is used to explain the Court's decisions on the reasonableness of a given search or seizure. The parameters are estimated through probit. The results show that the search and seizure cases are much more ordered than had commonly been believed. Virtually all of the estimates are as expected. Additionally, the Court is shown to act more favorably toward the federal government than toward the states.

In this paper we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit a Bayesian measurement model of ideal points for all justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1953 through 1999. We are particularly interested in determining to what extent ideal points of justices change throughout their tenure on the Court. This is important because judicial politics scholars oftentimes invoke preference measures that are time invariant. To investigate preference change, we posit a dynamic item response model that allows ideal points to change systematically over time. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian methods for fitting multivariate dynamic linear models to political scientists. Our results suggest that many justices do not have temporally constant ideal points. Moreover, our ideal point estimates outperform existing measures and explain judicial behavior quite well across civil rights, civil liberties, economics, and federalism cases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

First, we argue that employing the conventional measure of the Senate's power to constrain the president's choice of nominees–the median senator–provides an inaccurate picture of this process. In its stead we argue that the filibuster pivot (or the sixtieth most liberal or conservative senator) more accurately captures the Senate's power over the president (Krehbiel 1998). Second, we argue that even under this more stringent spatial constraint, presidents still have the ability to win most confirmation battles with the Senate. Indeed, our results indicate that presidents often overcome situations where the Senate should reject their nominees, or where it should force them to make a less desirable choice, by invoking political capital.},

Using national surveys and advances in subnational opinion estimation, we estimate state-level support for 39 policies across eight issue areas, including abortion, law enforcement, health care, and education. We show that policy is highly responsive to policy-specific opinion, even controlling for other influences. But we also uncover a striking “democratic deficit”: policy is congruent with majority will only half the time. The analysis considers the influence of institutions, salience, partisan control of government, and interest groups on the magnitude and ideological direction of this democratic deficit. We find the largest influences to be legislative professionalization, term limits, and issue salience. Partisanship and interest groups affect the ideological balance of incongruence more than the aggregate degree thereof.

Recent studies have argued that the low voter turnout that accompanies such off-cycle elections could create an advantage for interest groups. However, the endogeneity of election timing makes it difficult to estimate its causal effect on political out-comes. In this paper, I develop a theoretical framework that explains how changes to election timing affect the electoral fortunes of organized interest groups. I test the theory by examining the effects of a 2006 Texas law that forced approximately 20 percent of the state's school districts to move their elections to the same day as national elections. Using matching as well as district fixed effects regression, I estimate the causal effect of the switch to on-cycle election timing on district teacher salaries, since teachers and their unions tend to be the dominant * I thank},

abstract = {By the 1820s the federal government of the United States had begun to assume a form we would recognize today. In Washington the experiment in government under the Constitution was swiftly becoming enshrined in mature institutions, the most important of which was probably the Congress. Between 1810 and 1825 the two houses of the legislative branch underwent dramatic and lasting transformations in their organizational arrangements. In 1810 the House had a modest system of standing committees; the Senate had no such system at all. During the next 15 years the House steadily expanded its system, while the Senate produced one in a single fell swoop. By 1825 each chamber had a fully developed system of standing committees which have dominated its procedures to the present time. This paper documents these developments and seeks to account for them by explanations rational choice and organization theory.},

abstract = {This article studies a model of political parties as informative "brands" to voters. Voters across a large number of constituencies are assumed to be risk averse and incompletely informed about candidate ideal poli- cies, and candidates are unable to commit to a declared policy platform. In this environment, parties can play a critical role by aggregating ideo- logically similar candidates and sig- naling their preferences to voters. This signaling is effective because party membership imposes costs, which screen out candidates whose preferences are not sufficiently close to the party's platform. We find that when party labels are very informative, the parties' platforms converge. When party labels are less informative, however, platforms diverge, because taking an extreme position allows a party to reduce the variance of its members' preferences. As par? ties become less able to impose costs on their members, or less able to screen out certain types of candi? dates, their platforms move further apart.},

abstract = {While he concludes that group leaders most often appeal to the public when they perceive that their stand has widespread popular support, he also shows that there are many important and revealing exceptions to this pattern. Kollman develops his theory of outside lobbying through a combination of rational choice modeling and statistical tests that compare public opinion data with data from his interviews about interest groups' policy positions and activities. The tests reveal that group leaders use outside lobbying to take advantage of pre-existing public preferences, not to recruit members or to try to generate the mere appearance of grassroots support. In Outside Lobbying, Ken Kollman explores why and when interest group leaders in Washington seek to mobilize the public in order to influence policy decisions in Congress. In the past, political scientists have argued that lobbying groups make outside appeals primarily because of their own internal dynamics - to recruit new members, for example. Kollman, however, grants a more important role to the need for interest group leaders to demonstrate popular support on particular issues. He interviewed more than ninety interest group leaders and policy makers active on issues ranging from NAFTA to housing for the poor.

@article{Mendelson2011,
abstract = {Agency notice-and-comment rulemaking has been widely claimed to strengthen public participation and the democratic nature of governmental decision making. These claims have intensified as agencies have gained greater discretion over economic and health, safety, and environmental rules, as websites and e-mail have facilitated increasingly high levels of public comment, and as commentators have criticized the adequacy of presidential and congressional oversight of agencies. Some attention has been given to the extent of public participation, but we should also consider what agencies do and ought to do with the often enormous numbers of public comments they receive. This Foreword represents an initial foray into that issue. Agencies typically focus only on the technical comments, largely dismissing public policy and values-focused comments, even when they arrive in large numbers. Because values issues are typically relevant to an agency's implementation of its broad statutory responsibilities, however, the article makes a preliminary case that more thorough consideration of value-laden public comment could potentially enhance both the quality and democratic legitimacy of agency decision making. At the very least, it is time for more systematic evaluation of how agencies treat the comments they get.},

The first section of the Article explores participation's value to agency governance. The second section of the Article presents three models of agency governance - expertocratic, pluralist, and civic republican - and discusses participation's importance to each model. The Article then posits a distinction between ordinary and constitutive agency decisionmaking, and explores how participation affects each for the three distinct models of agency governance. The implications of mass participation are explored in the context of citizen suit provisions to enforce environmental laws, the Environmental Impact Statement process under the National Environmental Policy Act, and sunshine laws which require meetings of multi-member agencies to be open to the public. The Article concludes by suggesting that mass participatory reforms to administrative law have adverse implications for the models of agency governance in various contexts, but are particularly deleterious for civic republican theories of administrative law. Thus, the Article suggests, de-emphasizing participation in administrative law theory and reforms may work to make agency governance more democratic.},

We are closer than we ever have been to producing a behavioral model that integrates cognitive science yet does not produce a confusing overabundance of findings that have systems level implications. I conclude that we may well be at a tuning point in which the fully rational model of human choice, currently used as the microfoundation for economics and the study of political institutions, is replaced by a more robust behavioral model of choice that relies on developments in the cognitive sciences.},

abstract = {Given the extensive use of rule making in federal agencies, it is important that agency rulemakers have available as clear guidance as possible. As procedures governing the rulemaking process have proliferated since the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted, the potential procedural pitfalls have multiplied. This fifth edition continues the tradition, and brings the Guide up to date with respect to recent cases and changes introduced during the second term of the Bush II Administration, and the first three years of the Obama Administration. This Fifth Edition retains the basic organization of the previous four, containing four parts: Part I is an overview of federal agency rulemaking and describes the major institutional "players" and historical development of rulemaking. Part II describes the statutory structure of rulemaking, including the relevant sections of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and other statutes that have an impact on present-day rulemaking. Part III contains a step-by-step description of the informal rulemaking process, from the preliminary considerations to the final rule. Part IV discusses judicial review of rulemaking. Appendices include some key rulemaking documents.

Rather than accepting it as a novel power necessitated by modern society, he shows that it revives a version of medieval and early modern absolute power, including the royal prerogative. Then he traces resistance to administrative law from the Middle Ages to the present.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Congressional choices about administrative procedures affect an agency's political responsiveness and the technical accuracy of its decisions. Legislators would like to design procedures so that agencies make technically sound decisions and balance the needs of competing interests in the way intended. In practice, agency procedures designed to promote technical competence often allow for political drift, and those that promote political control provide little new technical information about the consequences of policy decisions. The trade-off between technical competence and political control is captured in a model of a legislative coalition's decision about agency procedures. The choice variables are the agency's expected preferences and independence. Depending on exogenous levels of technical and political uncertainty, optimal agency procedures can maximize technical competence, maximize political control, or achieve a combination of the two.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The high stakes and adversarial features of regulation create the worst possible climate for the honest production and use of science especially by those who will ultimately bear the cost of the resulting regulatory standards. Yet an in-depth exploration of the ways in which dominant interest groups distort the available science to support their positions has received little attention in the academic or popular literature. The book begins by establishing non-controversial principles of good scientific practice. These principles then serve as the benchmark against which each chapter author compares how science is misused in a specific regulatory setting and assist in isolating problems in the integration of science by the regulatory process. - Publisher.

abstract = {Empowered Participatory Governance, or EPG, is a model of governance developed by Archon Fung and Erik Olin Wright that seeks to connect a set of normative commitments for strengthening democracy with a set of institutional design prescriptions intended to meet that objective. It is derived partly from democratic theory and partly from the study of real-world attempts to institutionalize transformative strategies for democratizing social and political decision making. This paper reviews Fung and Wright's recent volume, Deepening Democracy: Institutional Innovations in Empowered Participatory Governance, and considers the relevance of the authors' and other contributors' insights for the future of a phenomenon called electronic rulemaking. Electronic rulemaking is a species of government on-line deliberation, which I call GOLD, that seeks to facilitate greater citizen involvement in the formal processes of elaborating administrative rules to implement federal law. Although the volume hardly mentions information and communications technologies at all, there readily appears an extraordinary fit between the capacities of new ICTs and the needs of EPG, in terms of both accomplishing a supportive context and actually implementing the recommended institutional designs. Whether electronic rulemaking will prove a significant way station towards EPG is uncertain, but, given the promise of the EPG experimental agenda and the need to enlarge opportunities for meaningful citizen participation in decisions that affect their lives, EPG proponents should give more active consideration to the potential role of GOLD initiatives in achieving EPG aims.},

abstract = {In administrative process sunlight may be the best disinfectant, but as Professor Strauss notes, the “candor and the flexibility necessary for collaboration or compromise are more likely to flourish in the shade.” This Study is designed to explore the engagement of interest groups over the entire life cycle of a rulemaking and to assess whether it is in fact in these shaded, or partly shaded phases where much of the regulatory work gets done. Specifically, we examine the air toxic emission standards set by EPA for over 100 major industries with respect to both participation and influence of interest groups at key points of the rulemaking life cycle - before the proposed rule is published; between notice and comment and the final rule; and after the final rule is published. The results reveal high levels of participation and stark imbalances among participating groups at each of these stages. At the pre-proposal stage, industry had an average of 84 informal communications with the EPA per rule; public interest groups had an average of 0.7 communications per rule. During the comment process, industry provided approximately 81{\%} of the total comments; public interest groups provided 4{\%}. Changes made to the final rule after notice and comment favored industry by a factor of 4 to 1 as compared to the changes benefitting the public interest. Post-final rule activity was considerable as well. Petitions and litigation occurred for 22{\%} of the rules, with industry filings accounting for 2 times those filed by public interest groups. After promulgation of the rules, moreover, roughly 70{\%} of the rules were revised and amended, with an average rate of over 4 revisions per rule for those that were revised at least once. These findings are consistent with other recent empirical research on the rulemaking process, but add to the evidence of extensive engagement outside of the reach of the APA as well as highlighting significant interest group imbalances at three discrete stages in the rulemaking process.},

abstract = {Distrust in intellectuals has pervaded American culture for centuries. This distrust, however, has
not led to a similar distrust in the scientific community. Aggregate trust and belief in science has
remained relatively stable over time. Recently, however, a partisan divide has formed in
judgements about science, the scientific community, and science issues such as policies
concerning climate change. Research on the relationship between science and politics has
focused on how partisan affiliations shape individual judgements about these scientific issues
and finds that partisan affiliations strongly influence an individual's judgments about science
issues and science-related policies. These efforts assume that partisan affiliations shape scientific
judgements. But attitudes about science may be more embedded than previously thought. I argue
that an individual's belief about the merits of science, called science efficacy, is a deep-seated,
central worldview. Instead of being a result of partisan affiliations, I find that science efficacy
consistently shapes partisan affiliations. Using longitudinal cross-sectional and panel survey
data, I demonstrate that science efficacy has a significant unidirectional impact on individual
partisanship and that this relationship is robust to accounting for science-based policy positions.
Taken together these results suggest science efficacy is central to partisan identity and is
increasingly important in the American political landscape.},

I argue that agencies can speed up (fast-track) or slow down (slow-roll) the rulemaking process in order to undermine political oversight provided by Congress, the president, and the courts. That is, when the political climate is favorable agencies rush to lock in a rule, but when it is less favorable they "wait out" the tenure of current political overseers. I find empirical support for this proposition using an event history analysis of more than 9,600 agency rules from 147 agencies.

"Ad hoc pork," generated by emergency or stimulus bills, is also analyzed. Its downsides can be fixed, according to the essay, by creating a preapproved roadmap for the appropriations process, thereby enhancing the quality of spending oversight. Finally, "presidential pork" derives from chief executives rewarding congressional allies and from government agencies allocating program resources so as to engender support from congressional members. This third variety of pork can be controlled if agencies improve their operational transparency plus strengthen their procedures for selecting projects.

The author explains and critiques earmark reform policies, including congressional rules, initiatives taken by the congressional appropriations committees, and reforms pursued by the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Congressional rules and committee-initiated reforms have been most effective, resulting in significant improvements in earmark transparency and accountability. The number and dollar value of earmarks first dropped noticeably in fiscal year 2007 after an earmark moratorium, and then stabilized as reforms were implemented. It is premature to conclude that these levels will continue or that reforms will alter the policy content of earmarks or their distribution among members of Congress. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The principals can each perform oversight of the implementation to limit information asymmetries exploited by the agent. Oversight is costly to perform and due to information leakages between principals, oversight by one principal reveals information to all principals. Thus for some values of the audit costs, there is a collective action problem in monitoring among the principals: the multiplicity of principals can cause the level of this form of oversight to be underperformed relative to the principals' joint interests. Notably, the multiplicity of principals reduces their collective control over the agent even though they have common interests about the agent's actions, i.e. conflicting preference about agent actions are not necessary to attenuate accountability when there are multiple principals.

However, race and affirmative action gerrymandering have no impact on public policy passed in Congress. Grose is the first to examine a natural experiment and exceptional moment in history in which black legislators - especially in the U.S. South - represented districts with a majority of white constituents. This is the first systematic examination of the effect of a legislator's race above and beyond the effect of constituency racial characteristics.

@misc{Livermore2013,
abstract = {This Article highlights the role of capture in providing a normative foundation for regulatory review of administrative action, which at the federal level is conducted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It also establishes a reform agenda to help bring the practice of review in line with its anti-capture justification. There are two traditional justifications for OIRA review: that centralized review facilitates the exercise of presidential authority over agencies; and that bureaucratic tendencies toward overzealousness require a centralized checking response. Both of these justifications are problematic, however. The normative desirability of maximizing presidential power is subject to debate, and OIRA's contribution to increasing presidential control is minimal. Bureaucratic incentives can lead to both over- and underregulation, raising doubts about the need for a systematic check focused solely on the former. An anti-capture function for OIRA provides a more promising ground for regulatory review. OIRA has four important features that, in principle, can facilitate an anti-capture role: its generalist nature; its coordination function; its use of cost-benefit analysis; and a tradition of independent leadership. There are, however, elements of OIRA review that undermine its anti-capture potential, most importantly the near exclusive focus on the review of agency action. The failure of an agency to act can be just as detrimental to social well-being as overzealousness, and special interests may seek deregulation, delay, and weak regulation as often as over-regulation. This Article proposes a specific mechanism for OIRA to engage in review of agency inaction by examining petitions for rulemakings filed with agencies. This procedure cabins OIRA's inaction review powers within a fairly limited field, making the task workable, and takes advantage of information held by parties outside the government.},

Existing research on the U.S. Congress suggests that electoral incentives shaped by the candidate-centered nature of congressional elections explain the emergence of strong committees in that legislature. Exploring the issue from a comparative perspective, it is argued that the impact of ballot structure on committee system structure is dependent on how legislators cultivate personal votes. Committees will be stronger when legislators supply fiscal legislative particularism (pork), but weaker when legislators cultivate support by delivering extra-legislative constituency service. Statistical analysis, combining original data on committee design in 39 democratic legislatures with measures of ballot structure and mechanism to cultivate a personal vote (MCPV), confirms the expectation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Purpose: Responsible sourcing of metals is characterized as an approach for life cycle management (LCM) and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) of social issues. The focus is on the supply of “conflict minerals”—tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG)—whose mining and trade are implicated in conflict and severe social conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Downstream manufacturers are using compliance strategies to reach multiple tiers and long distances into product chains to buy conflict-free sources of these metals from mines, smelters, and refineries. Methods: The research uses qualitative methods and public documents to compare 16 conflict mineral programs. A theoretical framework in three dimensions guided the enquiry into program governance, program standards, and certification processes. Additional empirical analysis of the conflict-free sourcing program, the largest and most central industry-led effort on conflict minerals, was supported by confidential access to audit reports, company policies, and management procedures on more than 140 metallurgical facilities. Results and discussion: In fewer than 4 years, conflict-free sourcing programs have impacted global 3TG metal supply chains, as indicated by pricing and significant producer compliance. Electronics, jewelry, and other manufacturers—many influenced by US conflict mineral regulation—are “pulling” metals markets for conflict-free sourcing. Private standard programs focus on product chain chokepoints to support efficient engagement: a limited number of 3TG facilities that are influenced to implement “responsibility management systems,” practice conflict-free sourcing, and undergo compliance audits. Some supply chains operate as closed pipelines along the full product chain from mine to end-product. Tantalum has been most successful as about 95 {\%} of producers are compliant; however, for gold, in particular, the scale of compliance is challenged. Conclusions: Downstream manufacturing industries are “governing at a distance” the management practices of upstream raw material producers. For LCM, responsible sourcing may be applicable to product chains with other metals and commodities. For SSCM, conflict-free sourcing indicates how compliance and supplier development strategies can penetrate multiple tiers into supply chains to address social issues in developing countries. Future research is needed on understanding more on supplier companies and their motivations and on sustainability performance outcomes for the conflict mineral problem.},

Environmental policies often outline myriad goals and numerous ways to achieve them. For example, policies may dictate a change in land use or crop production while promoting social development for communities. Yet environmental policies often fall short of meeting their goals. Federal policies that promote the expansion of oil palm in Mexico are examples of this type of measure that falls short of meeting its social goals as the crop expands and is used to meet other goals, such as diversifying commodity crops. There are few comprehensive policies that establish how oil palm production will be grown in an explicitly sustainable manner in terms of promoting the well being of society, the long- term profitability of the crop, and protection for the health of the environment (Solomon et al., 2015; Stattman and Mol, 2014). In the absence of strong federal policies, third- party certification and international sustainability standards offer the ability to meet such development goals while also promoting economically viable and environmentally safe oil palm production.},

@misc{Vuori2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited. The chapter aims to compare public, private and non-profit working citizens' preferences for cross-sectoral relations in England and Finland. Its main contribution is in identifying preferences in the delivery of services in the respective countries in which citizen choice has become an issue in times of public sector austerity. Challenges arise because in these two similarly institutionalized healthcare systems but pluralistic societies people have contrasting perspectives on the values that should guide policy decisions. The survey data was therefore collected in both England (N = 2,000) and Finland (N = 1,973) in 2013 from cities in which citizens have choices regarding health service delivery. Our informants in England anticipated more potential for better ‘privatized driven public interest' than did those in Finland. Surprisingly, over 60{\%} of public sector employees in England would like forprofit healthcare to carry main responsibility, and almost 55{\%} of all employees agree with this. Almost 20{\%} of respondents in both countries did not care who the service provider is if only services are available. Thus, the research has pioneering relevance for policymaking, public strategic management and the comparative empirical study of managing people's preferences in cross-sectoral relations. We conclude that identifying working citizens' preferences is crucial for effective utilization of current welfare services because the preferences derive from both service and work experience. In sum, strategically, this identification lets public managers balance biased images of the cross-sectoral differences and reconstruct functional hybridity of services.},

@article{Tomz2013,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}One of the most striking findings in political science is the democratic peace: the absence of war between democracies. Some authors attempt to explain this phenomenon by highlighting the role of public opinion. They observe that democratic leaders are beholden to voters and argue that voters oppose war because of its human and financial costs. This logic predicts that democracies should behave peacefully in general, but history shows that democracies avoid war primarily in their relations with other democracies. In this article we investigate not whether democratic publics are averse to war in general, but whether they are especially reluctant to fight other democracies. We embedded experiments in public opinion polls in the United States and the United Kingdom and found that individuals are substantially less supportive of military strikes against democracies than against otherwise identical autocracies. Moreover, our experiments suggest that shared democracy pacifies the public primarily by changing perceptions of threat and morality, not by raising expectations of costs or failure. These findings shed light on a debate of enduring importance to scholars and policy makers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This article presents six such lenses (calculated strategic behavior, experimentalism,

ontological assumptions, and explores implications for theory-building, the validity of
findings, and public policy advice. Finally, it argues that the continued siloization of

governance for agricultural commodities (i.e., eco-labels and certification systems), forested
areas are steadily declining while crop lands are growing. Deforestation continues despite
NSMD rules strictly prohibiting the conversion of forested land to agriculture. In this paper, we
ask why the growing presence of NSMD governance has coincided with ongoing deforestation.
While the seeming inability of NSMD governance to halt broader patterns of land use change
can be partially explained by a lack of market uptake, there are also a range of other variables
that may contribute to this relationship. We probe five hypotheses through comparative case
studies of sustainable soy certification in Brazil, palm oil in Indonesia, and cocoa in C{\^{o}}te
d'Ivoire. Our plausibility probe indicates that NSMD governance has neither abetted, nor
hindered, the conversion of forested land to agricultural production. We find strong evidence that
a lack of broad market uptake limits the effectiveness of NSMD governance. However, we also
find evidence that regulatory loopholes in NSMD systems may explain the inability of eco-labels
and certification systems to halt broader patterns of land use change in countries with
comparatively strong market uptake. Our results highlight critical problems related to expanding
the reach and stringency of NSMD governance alongside ongoing fragmentation of global

The static and change models reveal that conventional and online news use encourage political consumerism indirectly through their influence on political talk and environmental con-cerns. However, media use may also have some sup-pressive effects by reducing the desire to protect others from harmful messages. Results demonstrate how com-munication practices and consumption orientations work together to influence political consumerism beyond previously delineated factors. Implications for declines in political and civic participation and youth socialization are discussed. T he intersection of markets and politics has a long history. As Breen (2004) convincingly argued, consumer politics shaped the American Revolution and laid the groundwork for nation-hood. The colonists, who differed in many respects, shared an identity as aggrieved con-sumers of British goods. It was through their behavior as consumers that the colonists devel-oped their most innovative and potent form of political action: boycotts (Schudson 2007 [this volume]). The act of boycotting remains a powerful form of political engagement, though it is now seen as part of a much broader array of con-sumer behaviors that are shaped by a desire to express and support political and ethical per-spectives.

We present evidence that variations in political attitudes correlate with physiological traits. In a group of 46 adult participants with strong political beliefs, individuals with measurably lower physical sensitivities to sudden noises and threatening visual images were more likely to support foreign aid, liberal immigration policies, pacifism, and gun control, whereas individuals displaying measurably higher physiological reactions to those same stimuli were more likely to favor defense spending, capital punishment, patriotism, and the Iraq War. Thus, the degree to which individuals are physiologically responsive to threat appears to indicate the degree to which they advocate policies that protect the existing social structure from both external (outgroup) and internal (norm-violator) threats.},

In this article, we explore why these organizations share a set of core features that appear overly costly at first sight. We argue that norms that evolved out of the social interaction among transnational rule-making organizations account for this phenomenon. Thus, in the early 1990s, an organizational field of transnational rule-making has gradually developed in the field of environmental politics. Responding to a broader social discourse about global governance that stressed a need for innovative forms of cooperation among different societal sectors, this organizational field gained in legitimacy and strength. A set of commonly accepted core norms, the increasing density of interaction among the field's members, and the success and legitimacy ascribed to the field's key players by the outside world helped to solidify the organizational field until it eventually developed a ‘life of its own'.},

The results indicate that forest certification prompted substantial changes in practices. On average, firms implemented 13‐14 changes in forestry, environmental, social, and economic/system practices to obtain or maintain forest certification. Although there was no statistical difference between systems in the total number of changes, there were many differences in the implementation of specific forest practices, with FSC firms required to make more environmental/forest management changes and SFI firms required to make more economic/system changes. Forest managers believed that the benefits of forest certification were greater than the disadvantages. SFI managers rated the benefits of forest certification higher than FSC managers, but also rated the disadvantages higher. Most organizations felt certification accomplished their objectives and were likely to recertify, thus indicating their endorsement of the process.

abstract = {"Rethinking Private Authority examines the role of non-state actors in global environmental politics, arguing that a fuller understanding of their role requires a new way of conceptualizing private authority. Jessica Green identifies two distinct forms of private authority--one in which states delegate authority to private actors, and another in which entrepreneurial actors generate their own rules, persuading others to adopt them. Drawing on a wealth of empirical evidence spanning a century of environmental rule making, Green shows how the delegation of authority to private actors has played a small but consistent role in multilateral environmental agreements over the past fifty years, largely in the area of treaty implementation. This contrasts with entrepreneurial authority, where most private environmental rules have been created in the past two decades. Green traces how this dynamic and fast-growing form of private authority is becoming increasingly common in areas ranging from organic food to green building practices to sustainable tourism. She persuasively argues that the configuration of state preferences and the existing institutional landscape are paramount to explaining why private authority emerges and assumes the form that it does. In-depth cases on climate change provide evidence for her arguments. Groundbreaking in scope, Rethinking Private Authority demonstrates that authority in world politics is diffused across multiple levels and diverse actors, and it offers a more complete picture of how private actors are helping to shape our response to today's most pressing environmental problems"-- Cover; Title; Copyright; Dedication; Contents; List of Illustrations; Acknowledgments; Acronyms; Introduction; Chapter 1.

In this article, I investigate when and why governments choose to interact with and use private rules about carbon offsets in public regulatory arrangements. The analysis demonstrates that there is “blurring” between public and private authority, insofar that there are a multiple interactions between the two spheres. However, a closer look reveals that most of these are of a relatively weak nature, since private standards are used for voluntary rather than compliance purposes. To explain this trend, I use qualitative and quantitative analysis and find that NGOs are the main catalysts for the interaction between public and private rules. States are most likely to interact with private regulations when they have large numbers of NGOs active within their borders. In short, private authority is largely a complement to public regulatory arrangements. While previous work that suggests that private author...},

A monopoly NGO engages in “donor-stretching,” choosing a mission statement that includes issues not preferred by any of its donors, but still narrower than socially desirable. Under free entry, issue-widths are strategic complements amongst NGOs. In equilibrium there are too many NGOs, each with too narrow a mission. The issue-space is exactly donor-covered (all donors will have an NGO they wish to give to) but issue over-covered (mission statements overlap).

Focusing on racial and ethnic minority concerns, this book shows that the context of political protest has served as a signal for political preferences. As pro-minority rights behavior grew and anti-minority rights actions declined, politicians learned from minority protest and responded when they felt emboldened by stronger informational cues stemming from citizens' behavior, a theory referred to as the "information continuum." Given the influence that minority protest actions have wielded over national government, the book offers a powerful implication.

abstract = {Although minority protest is often characterized as an effective form of political participation, previous research has been unsuccessful in establishing a direct link between protest activity and congressional support for minority interests. However, the shortcoming of the existing literature is related to an analytical focus at the aggregate level, where only the passage of congressional legislation and national-level protest events are considered. By linking district-level minority protest actions to individual roll-call votes on race, I hypothesize that minority activism can indicate constituency preferences and inform legislators' votes. This analytical approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the influence that citizens' behavior has on congressional policy. Using protest data and congressional roll-call votes from the 87th to the 101st Congress, the empirical analysis demonstrates that representatives are attuned to the social conditions of their district and use minority protest as an informative cue that},

Drawing upon the `strength of weak ties' argument, the authors argue that policy information passes more through acquaintances (`weak ties') than through close, trusted, contacts (`strong ties'). They support this argument in an analysis of data on lobbying networks in health-care policy-making in the 1970s and 1980s. The statistical analyses show that access to policy-makers in Washington is network-autocorrelated: a lobbyist's access depends upon the access of other lobbyists s/he knows.

Given the prominence of the concepts of agency ideology and skill in theories of executive branch politics, the estimates we generate provide important opportunities for understanding agencies' political environments and their implications for policy making.

A feedback perspective encourages us to ask how policy implementation transforms the webs of political relations that constitute governance. Administrators play a key role in shaping the political conditions of bureaucratic performance and the organization of power in the broader polity. At the same time, this perspective underscores that policies are more than just objects of administrative action. Policies are political forces in their own right that can alter key components of administration, including phenomena such as organizational capacity, structures, routines, authorities, motivations and cultures. These sorts of administrative themes have received little attention in policy feedback research, just as the political effects of policies have been overlooked in public administration studies. Bridging these perspectives offers a basis for exciting new agendas and advances in public administration research.},

A nascent literature has emerged over the past two decades whose underpinnings reflect increasing gravitation towards a transactional authority perspective, one that is compatible with behavioral theories of organizations. This transactional authority perspective departs from an exclusive reliance on formal mechanisms insofar that agent compliance is motivated by either mutual or bilateral agreement for both the principal and the agent. This perspective is rooted in not only the agent's "sanctioned acceptance" of the principal's authority but also the principal's "sanctioned acceptance" of the agent's legitimacy. We explore the logical implications of this transactional authority perspective for better understanding principal-agent relationships in the study of bureaucratic politics. We conclude by recommending that future research should redirect scholarly attention towards analyzing informal compliance and resistance mechanisms in bureaucratic politics, as well as offer a richer pluralist conception of bureaucratic governance in a democracy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. Drawing up environmental policy options is a complex activity which involves defining and weighing the merits and risks of various alternative courses of action governments could pursue. In its modern version, this task typically involves formal policy analysis or ‘policy appraisal', that is, policy work specifically undertaken to generate and evaluate policy options in order to address problems or issues on a policy agenda. Indicators play a powerful but under-investigated role in this process. To shed light on this issue, the paper conducts a case study of the design and evolution of policy indicators in water security policy formulation, examining both their utilization and impact. The paper documents the origins of water security policy indicators; assesses their relevance and influence in policy formulation and identifies the reasons for the emergence of certain preferred indices, despite their having several well-known limitations. In particular, the discussion flags the significance of the political advantages surrounding their ease of use and interpretation, rather than their technical merits, as a key factor affecting the continued utilization and influence of specific indicators in environmental policy and planning.},

We show when and why climate change exhibits features of a sustained under-reaction: Governments may react to concerns about climate change not through substantive change but by efforts to manage blame strategically. As long as they can avoid blame for potential negative policy outcomes policy-makers can act to deny problems, or implement only small-scale or symbolic reforms. While this pattern may change as climate change problems worsen and public recognition of the issue and what can be done about it alters, opportunities to manage blame will still exist. Governments will only revert to more substantive interventions when attempts to fatalistically frame the problem as unavoidable fail in the face of increased public visibility.},

It contrasts the behavioral premises (bounded rationality and opportunism) of the transaction cost approach with those of more traditional budgetary theories, and examines whether commitment and agency costs have structured budget actors' institutional choices. Investigation of the usage of key budget instruments-entitlements, multi-year appropriations, and tax expenditures - suggests that Congress has been more discriminating in its institutional choices than is commonly supposed.

abstract = {Long the lifeblood of public administration, budgeting in the United States acquired a new importance during the 1980s and 1990s because of the fiscalization of the policy debate. But how much has American national budgeting really changed? This article examines the evolution of federal budgeting over the past half-century, exploring such developments as the massive growth of entitlements, congressional budget reform, and the protracted battle over the budget deficit. It finds that year-to-year changes in budget results have been relatively small even while budgetary rules and procedures have experienced sweeping change. At the same time, the composition of federal spending has undergone a quiet revolution. The traditional concept of budgetary incrementalism offers an incomplete explanation for these dynamics. To make sense of them, the article focuses on two key factors: the impact of policy inheritances, and the role of actors' causal and normative beliefs. These factors shape the ideational and material context within which boundedly rational actors negotiate decisions. The tension between changes in ideas and entrenched budgetary commitments has often served to stimulate institutional reform.},

Different conceptions of institutional emergence underlie different answers to this question. Many scholars argue that firms create certification systems to solve problems in the market—a view rooted in a conception of institutions as solutions to collective action prob- lems. The author develops a different account by viewing institu- tions as the outcome of political contestation and by analyzing con- flict and institutional entrepreneurship among a wide array of actors. Using a comparative case study design, the analysis shows how these arguments explain the formation of social and environmental cer- tification associations. Both theoretical approaches are needed, but strong versions of the market-based approach overlook an important set of dynamics that the author calls the “political construction of market institutions.” The analysis shows how both problem solving in markets and political contention generate new institutional forms.},

Some recent theoretical thought in political science, however, blends elements of these theoretical styles into an older concern with institutions. This new institutionalism emphasizes the relative autonomy of political institutions, possibilities for inefficiency in history, and the importance of symbolic action to an understanding of politics. Such ideas have a reasonable empirical basis, but they are not charac- terized by powerful theoreticalforms. Some directions for theoretical research may, however, be iden- tified in institutionalist conceptions of political order. },

Yet research on policy feedback is mostly anecdotal, and there has so far been little attempt to develop more general hypotheses about the conditions under which policies produce politics. Drawing on recent research, this article suggests that feedback occurs through two main mechanisms. Policies generate resources and incentives for political actors, and they provide those actors with information and cues that encourage particular interpretations of the political world. These mechanisms operate in a variety of ways, but have significant effects on government elites, interest groups, and mass publics. By investigating how policies influence different actors through these distinctive mechanisms, the article outlines a research agenda for moving from the current focus on illustrative case studies to the investigation of broader propositions about how and when policies are likely to be politically consequential.},

Notes

From research for Tuohy. This is a good article to read. Has the latest stuff and looks at the idea of policy creating politics. Could be good for my theoretical chapter.


Brings up Esping-Anderson under the section on Feedback Effects on Mass Publics (p. 605):

"Esping-Andersen's detailed investigation of social policy and occupational structures in the United States, Sweden, and Germany persuasively links public policy structures to the socieconomic circumstances of mass publics. Emerging variations in the rate of growth of service industries, the relative weight of social services as opposed to personal servcies, the skill and occupatoinal composition of the labor force, and the distribution of jobs by gender and racial or ethnic background can all be traced in part to previous policy choices. What The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism does not do in more than a cursory way is investigate how these shifts in the circumstances of mass publics influence political processes. But the importance of the transformations Esping-Anderson identifies suggests that such an investigation would probably yield rich returns."},

abstract = {The prevailing political science wisdom is that narrow interests regularly triumph over the general public. Yet the stunning passage of broad-based policy reforms in the face of intense clientele opposition suggests that the U.S. political system has a greater capacity to serve diffuse interests than has often been thought. Some of the most provocative policy-oriented political-science research during the 1980s and 1990s examined how these surprising reform victories occurred. Unfortunately, general-interest reforms do not always stick; reforms may be corrupted or reversed after their enactment. The long-term sustainability of any given policy reform hinges on the successful reworking of political institutions and on the generation of positive policy-feedback effects, especially the empowerment of social groups with a stake in the reform{\&}s maintenance. This paper explores the postenactment dynamics of three canonical instances of general-interest reform legislation: tax reform, agricultural subsidy reform, and airline deregulation. Only in the airline-deregulation case has the self-reinforcing dynamic required for political sustainability been unmistakably evident. For analysts and advocates of general-interest reform measures alike, the clear lesson is to attend far more closely to what happens after reforms become law.},

abstract = {While a number of scholars have evaluated the strategies driving congressional decisions to delegate regulatory authority to administrative agencies, the literature has been largely restricted to evaluating the relationship between Congress and its administrative agent. I argue that this presents an incomplete picture of implementation given that it is typically carried out by multiple administrative actors that interact in multiple contexts and that share political principals. Such arrangements for overlapping jurisdiction and interagency organizations provide opportunities for agencies to learn from one another about the constraints of the political environment within which they are operating. This paper provides a preliminary examination of the extent to which adminis-trative agencies can learn from other agencies the preferences of shared political principals and use that information to reshape their regulatory strategies. Using original data on Court of Appeals litigation directed at administrative agencies from the 93rd to the 113th Congress, as well as con-gressional delegation to administrative agencies within the text of the Statutes at Large, I provide preliminary evidence that when an agency observes a closely-linked agency facing legal constraints, it reshapes its own regulatory strategy so as to provoke less costly litigation. The results pave the way toward further, more in-depth examination of the spillover effects of bureaucratic punishment and the ways in which this inter-agency learning takes place over time.},

@article{Seifter2016UCLA,
abstract = {Administrative law has long been fixated on public participation. Countless procedures and doctrines, along with their underlying normative theories, embrace participation as a crucial part of what makes the administrative state legitimate. It is well-recognized that interest groups dominate this participation. Yet the implications of interest-group dominance have been largely overlooked. Administrative law takes virtually no notice of how the dependence on interest groups affects the claimed value of participation. This Article argues that a close study of interest groups is essential to understanding, and ultimately reforming, administrative participation. It introduces the concept of second-order participation to describe the internal operation of interest groups. It then shows that second-order participation complicates every leading justification of administrative participation and the many practices built atop those justifications. These traditional conceptions of participation cohere only if groups actually speak for a membership, or at least provide information about how and for whom they work. Yet interest groups are seldom transparent, and, as this Article shows, they fall along a spectrum of internal governance with varying degrees of principal-agent slack — with the most effective lobbyists tending to have the greatest slack or no members at all. Attending to second-order participation thus provides a new framework for understanding participation, and it illuminates a path for reform.},

Emerging market based approaches are driven by shareholder expectations as well as commitment to corporate social responsibility, whereas community engagement is increasingly centered on the questions of social license to operate. Third party assessment and certification links state, market and community into an interesting and challenging hybrid form of governance. While civil society organizations have long been active in pursuing sustainable and safe seafood production, the development of formal non-state based certification provides both opportunities and challenges, and opens up interesting debates over hybrid forms of governance. This paper explores these developments in coastal marine resources management, focusing on aquaculture and the development and operation of the Aquaculture Stewardship Council. It examines the case of salmonid aquaculture in Tasmania, Australia, now Australia's most valuable seafood industry, which remains the focus of considerable community debate over its siting, operation and environmental impact.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, RIS. What capacities are needed on the part of policymakers in areas such as the agri-food biotechnology sector in order to attain excellence at the individual, organisational and systemic levels of regulatory operation? To address this question, this paper draws upon work recently carried out on regulatory excellence by the Penn Programme on Regulation and couples it with recent studies on how to build policy capacity. Derived from a multi-jurisdiction, multi-sector review of regulation, the Penn programme identified three core areas or ‘pillars' of regulatory excellence–namely, stellar competence, empathic engagement and utmost integrity –which reflect the kinds of individual actions of a regulator, the traits of the regulator as an organisation, and the broad systemic outcomes of regulation which are needed for excellent performance. This work does not examine what is needed on the part of public organisations to achieve these goals, however, and to this end, the paper draws upon a second set of recent studies into the various types of policy capacities that affect policy-making to illustrate what regulators must do in order to achieve excellence. Examples from agri-food biotechnology regulation are used to illustrate the concepts of, and prerequisites for, achieving regulatory capacity and excellence in this sector, although the lessons and implications are also valid in many others.},

abstract = {River and stream rehabilitation projects are increasing in number, but the success or failure of these projects has rarely been evaluated, and the extent to which buffers can restore riparian and stream function and species composition is not well understood. In New Zealand the widespread conversion of forest to agricultural land has caused degradation of streams and riparian ecosystems. We assessed nine riparian buffer zone schemes in North Island, New Zealand that had been fenced and planted (age range from 2 to 24 years) and compared them with unbuffered control reaches upstream or nearby. Macroinvertebrate community composition was our prime indicator of water and habitat quality and ecological functioning, but we also assessed a range of physical and water quality variables within the stream and in the riparian zone. Generally, streams within buffer zones showed rapid improvements in visual water clarity and channel stability, but nutrient and fecal contamination responses were variable. Significant changes in macroinvertebrate communities toward "clean water" or native forest communities did not occur at most of the study sites. Improvement in invertebrate communities appeared to be most strongly linked to decreases in water temperature, suggesting that restoration of in-stream communities would only be achieved after canopy closure, with long buffer lengths, and protection of headwater tributaries. Expectations of riparian restoration efforts should be tempered by (1) time scales and (2) spatial arrangement of planted reaches, either within a catchment or with consideration of their proximity to source areas of recolonists.},

abstract = {The dominant political-economic approaches to global trade flows known as global value chains and global production networks offer powerful insights into the coordination and location of globally stretched supply chains, in particular from global South to North. By way of both conceptual and empirical challenge, this paper highlights flows of end-of-life goods from the global North towards the global South. This involves the disassembly and destruction of goods to recover secondary resources for further rounds of commodity production. Global recycling networks take things of rubbish value (often spent or ‘end-of-life' goods) and turn them back into resources in other places and production networks. They operate not through adding value, but by connecting different regimes of value. The paper does not set out a new conceptual framework, but asks what challenges the rekindling of value in used goods creates for global commodity chain analysis and what insights those approaches bring to looking at ‘waste' flows. The examples of used clothing and end-of-life merchant ships are mobilised to illustrate the dynamics of global recycling networks and to challenge prevailing commodity chain approaches in three key areas – supply logics and crosscutting networks, value and materiality, and inter-firm governance. We argue that resource recovery engenders highly complex and brokered forms of governance that relate to practices of valuing heterogeneous materials and which contrast markedly with the modes of co-ordination dominated by ‘big capital typical of global production networks for consumer goods.},

abstract = {This article focuses on analysing the consequences for global governance of the growing power of the world's biggest retailers, illustrating with the case of global forest governance. It argues that the rising power of big retail within global commodity chains is creating both significant challenges – and some opportunities – for global environmental governance. The analysis suggests a need for IR to focus more on the shifting political power of multinational corporations, as both barriers to, and progress in, the governance of complex global issues such as deforestation and climate change increasingly occur in the corporate sphere. More specifically, the authors see great value in bringing research on globalising commodity chains back into IR, first revealing the power dynamics within these chains, then building on this to analyse the implications for global change and world politics. This reinforces and complements the message in Bernstein et al. (in this volume) that understanding the future of global climate governance must include the complex interactions between transnational governance practices and interstate negotiations. But it also suggests a need for IR scholars to go even further to unpack the consequences of how the shifting power dynamics of governance practices within the corporate sphere are intersecting – or running parallel – with more overarching multilateral and transnational environmental processes.

abstract = {In recent years, transnational and domestic nongovernmental organizations have created non–state market–driven (NSMD) governance systems whose purpose is to develop and implement environmentally and socially responsible management practices. Eschewing traditional state authority, these systems and their supporters have turned to the market's supply chain to create incentives and force companies to comply. This paper develops an analytical framework designed to understand better the emergence of NSMD governance systems and the conditions under which they may gain authority to create policy. Its theoretical roots draw on pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy granting distinctions made within organizational sociology, while its empirical focus is on the case of sustainable forestry certification, arguably the most advanced case of NSMD governance globally. The paper argues that such a framework is needed to assess whether these new private governance systems might ultimately challenge existing state–centered authority and public policy–making processes, and in so doing reshape power relations within domestic and global environmental governance.

In this article, we show that the efficacy of ISO 14001, the most widely adopted voluntary environmental regime in the world, is conditioned by the stringency of countries' domestic regulations. In doing so, we outline a model of strategic corporate environmentalism wherein firms strategically focus their International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification to reduce emissions of visible air pollutants as opposed to less visible water pollutants. Our analyses of pollution levels for a panel of 159 countries (73 for water pollution) from 1991 to 2005 indicate that ISO 14001 certifications reduce air (SO2) emissions in countries with less stringent environmental regulations but have no effect on air emissions in countries with stringent environmental regulations.

abstract = {Voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) have been used as a policy tool in the United States since the early 1990s and come in many forms. Early assessments of VEPs targeting changes in production processes showed that industrial participants improved their environmental performance and VEPs were celebrated as a viable alternative to more traditional regulation. Recent analyses using more sophisticated techniques, however, paint a less favorable picture. On the one hand, firms appear willing to sign up to VEPs, and in some cases, participants may be able to create a shield against future losses in shareholder value. On the other hand, these VEPs targeting production processes appear not to generate significant pollution abatement. The latter finding is particularly disturbing and this article discusses various explanations, including institutional failure and participant motivations. Future research needs to focus on understanding the firm motivation to invest in production-related pollution abatement under a VEP. For policymakers, the research offers a warning on the limited impact to date of VEPs targeting production processes. However, the multitude of other VEPs, such as those which target new product development and changing market demands, merit a closer look to determine the overall potential of VEPs to engender positive environmental change.

While these processes imply dynamic connections among political actors, researchers often cannot observe such interdependence. One example is public policy diffusion, which has long been a focus of multiple subfields. In the American state politics context, diffusion is commonly conceptualized as a dyadic process whereby states adopt policies (in part) because other states have adopted them. This implies a policy diffusion network connecting the states. Using a dataset of 187 policies, we introduce and apply an algorithm that infers this network from persistent diffusion patterns. The results contribute to knowledge on state policy diffusion in several respects. Additionally, in introducing network inference to political science, we provide scholars across the discipline with a general framework for empirically recovering the latent and dynamic interdependence among political actors.},

On the other hand, the costs of delivering press conferences espoused by some scholars insinuate that press conferences will have little impact on news coverage. To determine whether the press conference influences news coverage, I use plagiarism detection software to assess the propensity of television news to incorporate the president's rhetoric into stories that cover the president's press conferences.

abstract = {We propose Hetero-Labeled LDA (hLLDA), a novel semi-supervised topic model, which can learn from multiple types of labels such as document labels and feature labels (i.e., heterogeneous labels), and also accommodate labels for only a subset of classes (i.e., partial labels). This addresses two major limitations in existing semi-supervised learning methods: they can incorporate only one type of domain knowledge (e.g. document labels or feature labels), and they assume that provided labels cover all the classes in the problem space. This limits their applicability in real-life situations where domain knowledge for labeling comes in different forms from different groups of domain experts and some classes may not have labels. hLLDA resolves both the label heterogeneity and label partialness problems in a unified generative process.

hLLDA can leverage different forms of supervision and discover semantically coherent topics by exploiting domain knowledge mutually reinforced by different types of labels. Experiments with three document collections–Reuters, 20 Newsgroup and Delicious– validate that our model generates a better set of topics and efficiently discover additional latent topics not covered by the labels resulting in better classification and clustering accuracy than existing supervised or semi-supervised topic models. The empirical results demonstrate that learning from multiple forms of domain knowledge in a unified process creates an enhanced combined effect that is greater than a sum of multiple models learned separately with one type of supervision.},

The results show that the activists' discourse included many issues, although greatest attention was given to three: electoral and party systems, democracy and governance, and civil liberties. Moreover, the study reveals that the media covered all the movement's issues and that activists maintained their plural discourse throughout the protest. This article contributes to the literature on ‘connective' social movements, showing that in certain circumstances these movements have the capacity to determine media coverage.

Does heavy auditing encourage it to substitute multiple small regulations in place of single large
one, “OIRA avoidance”? We present an early empirical analysis of these questions by estimating
regulation production functions for federal agencies, using data from the Unified Agenda
from 1995 to 2010. We attempt to distinguish the differential effects of regulatory auditing
from appointments into the agencies, leveraging off exogenous variation created by independent
regulatory commissions. Our data uncover no evidence of a chilling effect in the production of
economically significant regulations due to the Bush administration's regulatory auditing,
relative to the Clinton or early Obama administrations. Nor do we find any evidence of OIRA
avoidance. We do find some evidence that the Bush administration reduced the production of
noneconomically significant regulations overall. However, the effect appears to be due to appointments
in the agencies. Overall, the results raise questions about the efficacy of presidential efforts
to control the regulatory state and how best to evaluate those efforts.},

 explores the impact of state level environmental characteristics on
 the use of discretion. Specifically this article tests whether street-

 interesting because state officials have an incentive to increase
 the number of disability recipients since the federal government
 funds the entire program. The findings in the article indicate that
 variation in the implementation of the Social Security Disability
 program is a function of levels of need for benefits, the health of
 the economy, and state partisan politics. Taken together the find-
 ings suggest that professional norms play a large role in directing
 the ways that street-level bureaucrats use their discretion. The
 implementation of the Social Security program is not, however,
 apolitical. While the bureaucracy is professional, it is also
 responsive to local political concerns. Although street-level
 bureaucracies seem open to influence from political officials, they
 do not respond to fiscal stress on state governments nor to high
 levels of social commitments. This indicates that state govern-
 ments do not use the disability program strategically, but play a
 more indirect role by creating an environment that is ideological-

A pooled time-series design is used to examine the interplay of national and subnational influences on the oversight decisions of officials at the U.S. Office of Surface Mining (OSM, Department of the Interior) during the period 1985-1989. The analysis indicates that the regulatory decisions of federal authorities at OSM reflect shifts in the nation's political climate, the freelancing efforts of individual members of Congress, and the states' political climates.

Contrary to Kaufman's vision of the Forestry Service, with strong institutional control and centralized policy, Lipsky 's street level bureaucrats often engage in a significant level of policy interpretation and make determinations of policy implementation without the guidance of a centralized authority. These individuals have to simplify and routinize their behavior and client interaction in order to balance massive caseloads and the result is often that street level policy and statute diverge. Differences in policy implementation, and variation between individual cases, serves to undermine the sense of fairness and effectiveness on the part of state clients.

abstract = {Ainsworth et al. look at the use of signing statements as a means of asserting pr esidential power, but situate that action within the context of the Congressional response it inspires. Leveraging signing statement data from 1995 to 2007, they find evidence that congressional committees with the relevant agency oversight react to the nu mber of objections raised by signing statements, and rather simply ceding authority to the President, will instead respond with a greater degree of oversight. They theorize that Congress uses the signing statement as a declaration that the President will m ove away from the legislative intent during the implementation of the law. 

ABSTRACT: Popular and scholarly accounts argue that signing statements are important tools for presidents to shape the implementation of policy. Although signing statements might be important presidential tools, the legislative branch stands in the most immediate and direct competition with the executive for ultimate control of the bureaucracy. In this article, we assess whether congressional committees react to presidential signing statements with increased oversight. Using a data set that includes every oversight hearing held by the U.S. House between 1995 and 2007, we find evidence that congressional committees are sensitive to the number of objections raised by presidents in signing statements. As the president uses signing statements to object to a larger number of provisions in laws, the affected House committees respond with more oversight.},

@article{Howell2002b,
abstract = {Scholars have largely ignored one of the most important ways in which presidents influence the administrative state in the modern era, that is, by creating administrative agencies through executive action. Because they can act unilaterally, presidents alter the kinds of administrative agencies that are created and the control they wield over the federal bureaucracy. We analyze the 425 agencies established between 1946 and 1995 and find that agencies created by administrative action are significantly less insulated from presidential control than are agencies created through legislation. We also find that the ease of congressional legislative action is a significant predictor of the number of agencies created by executive action. We conclude that the very institutional factors that make it harder for Congress to legislate provide presidents new opportunities to create administrative agencies on their own, and to design them in ways that maximize executive control.

Lewis and Howell examine 425 new agencies created between 1946 and 1995 (1096) by the exercise of unilateral executive action and de monstrate that bureaucracies created under the guise of executive action are much more susceptible to p residential control. They also find an inverse relationship between congressional strength and unilateral activity, meaning that when Congress is stronge st, the executive is much less likely to act unilaterally. As they state, “these findings suggest that the very institutional factors that undermine Congress augment presidential influence and control (1096).” This work marks an interesting change in direc tion for the presidential literature, which prior to this article has focused primarily on presidential control of agencies already in existence. },

@article{Moe1999b,
abstract = {In this article we highlight a formal basis for presidential power that has gone largely unappreciated to this point, but has become so pivotal to presidential leadership and so central to an understanding of presidential power that it virtually defines what is distinctively modern about the modern presidency. This is the president's formal capacity to act unilaterally and thus to make law on his own. Our central purpose is to set out a theory of this aspect of presidential power. We argue that the president's powers of unilateral action are a force in American politics precisely because they are not specified in the Constitution. They derive their strength and resilience from the ambiguity of the contract. We also argue that presidents have incentives to push this ambiguity relentlessly to expand their own powers—and that, for reasons rooted in the nature of their institutions, neither Congress nor the courts are likely to stop them. We are currently in the midst of a research project to collect comprehensive data for testing this theory—data on what presidents have done, as well as on how Congress and the courts have responded. Here we provide a brief history of unilateral action, with special attention to the themes of our theoretical argument. We also make use of some early data to emerge from our project. For now it appears that the theory is well supported by the available evidence. This is a work in progress, however, and more is clearly needed before definitive conclusions can be justified. A few observations about politics are so widely accepted that virtually all po-litical scientists have committed them to memory. One of these is Richard Neustadt's (1960) famous dictum, " Presidential power is the power to per-suade, " which expresses, in shorthand form, his view that the powers of the modern American presidency are rooted in the personal qualities of the indi-vidual occupying the office—in his skills, his temperament, and his experience. This notion of the personal presidency dominated the field for decades, but its influence is on the decline. The main reason is that it seems increasingly out of sync with the facts. The personal presidency became a popular theoretical notion just as the American presidency was experiencing tremendous growth},

We show that a model allowing preferences to vary over substantive issues as well as over time is a significantly better predictor of judicial behavior than one that only allows preferences to vary over time. We find that judicial preferences are not reducible to simple left-right ideology and, as a consequence, there is substantial variation in the identity of the median justice across areas of the law during all periods of the modern court.

After reading many of such papers I have decided to write such a survey myself. Hence, in this paper, every study relevant to the matter of electoral prediction using social media is commented.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Can American presidents use their budget proposal authority to achieve their own partisan policy priorities? This is an important, yet challenging, question to answer since formal executive authority is ambiguous, and budgetary powers are shared in the US separation of powers system. Indeed, the question remains open since prior empirical designs conflate external constraints (arising from political and policy conditions) with those that reflect executive partisan policy priorities. This study advances a novel stochastic decomposition of executive budget proposals in order to analyze the extent to which presidents can shape the legislative funding of US federal agencies consistent with their own partisan policy priorities. Statistical evidence reveals that presidents exert partisan-based budgetary influence over appropriations that cannot be ascertained from previous empirical studies that rely on either the observed gap between presidential requests and congressional appropriations or standard instrumental variable estimation methods. The statistical evidence also indicates that presidents are marginally more effective at converting their partisan policy priorities into budgetary outcomes under divided party government. Contrary to theoretical predictions generated from bilateral veto bargaining models, presidents are also shown to exert effective partisan budgetary influence even when their budget requests exceed congressional appropriations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {"Throughout American history, some social movements, such as organized labor and the Christian Right, have forged influential alliances with political parties, while others, such as the antiwar movement, have not. When Movements Anchor Parties provides a bold new interpretation of American electoral history by examining five prominent movements and their relationships with political parties. Taking readers from the Civil War to today, Daniel Schlozman shows how two powerful alliances--those of organized labor and Democrats in the New Deal, and the Christian Right and Republicans since the 1970s--have defined the basic priorities of parties and shaped the available alternatives in national politics. He traces how they diverged sharply from three other major social movements that failed to establish a place inside political parties--the abolitionists following the Civil War, the Populists in the 1890s, and the antiwar movement in the 1960s and 1970s. Moving beyond a view of political parties simply as collections of groups vying for preeminence, Schlozman explores how would-be influencers gain influence--or do not. He reveals how movements join with parties only when the alliance is beneficial to parties, and how alliance exacts a high price from movements. Their sweeping visions give way to compromise and partial victories. Yet as Schlozman demonstrates, it is well worth paying the price as movements reorient parties' priorities."--Publisher's Web site.

Using data derived from briefs filed by litigants over ten terms, we develop systematic tests of how requests for judicial review of state and federal laws influence U.S. Supreme Court justices. We find that while many appear to base their decisions to strike or uphold state or federal laws on ideological considerations, the Court itself can be called restraintist in that it never appears to strike laws sua sponte, and most requests for the review are voted down. Finally, we find little evidence of strategic considerations in the justices' decisions.},

We use the framework to structure an empirical analysis of a random sample of 500 Supreme Court cases, yielding over 10,000 subsequent treatments in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. When the contemporary Supreme Court is ideologically estranged from the enacting Supreme Court, lower courts treat precedent much more harshly. Controlling for the ideological distance between the enacting and contemporary Supreme Courts, the preferences of the contemporary lower court itself are unrelated to its behavior. Hence, hierarchical control appears strong and effective. At the same time, however, a lower court's previous treatments of precedent strongly influence its later treatments. The results have important implications for understanding legal change and suggest new directions for judicial principal-agency theory.},

abstract = {Although the term "empirical research" has become commonplace in legal scholarship over the past two decades, law professors have in fact been conducting research that is empirical-that is, learning about the world using quantitative data or qualitative information-for almost as long as they have been conducting research. For just as long, however, they appear to have been proceeding with little awareness of, much less compliance with, many of the rules of inference, and without paying heed to the key lessons of the revolution in empirical analysis that has been taking place over the last century in other disciplines. The tradition of including some articles devoted exclusively to the methodology of empirical analysis-so well represented in journals in traditional academic fields-is virtually nonexistent in the nation's law reviews. As a result, readers learn considerably less accurate information about the empirical world than the studies' stridently stated, but overly confident, conclusions suggest. To remedy this situation both for the producers and consumers of empirical work, this Article adapts the rules of inference used in the natural and social sciences to the special needs, theories, and data in legal scholarship, and explicates them with extensive illustrations from existing research. The Article also offers suggestions for how the infrastructure of teaching and research at law schools might be reorganized so that it can better support the creation of first-rate empirical research without compromising other important objectives.},

The adoption of the 17th Amendment in 1913 replaced this system with the direct election of senators. In this article, we use an original data set of recorded ballots for U.S. Senate elections in state legislatures from 1871 to 1913 to illustrate the dynamics of indirect elections. Our broad goal is to identify components of the process that shed light on who was elected to the Senate under this type of electoral system and how indirect elections fared as a mechanism of representation. We find significant evidence that under the indirect electoral mechanism, Senate elections were contentious, and winning majority control of the state legislature did not always ensure an easy electoral process. Specifically, the breakdown of caucus nominating processes, the size of majority coalitions, and whether the incumbent senator was running for reelection each exerted an effect on the probability of conflict in the indirect election process.},

First, it offered a sophisticated, fine-grained analysis of a political development of enormous importance to millions of people living in advanced democracies: the attempt of conservative politicians to curb social expenditure during the 1980s.

Arguing that Americans have misconceived the relation between democracy, private property, and the economic order, the author contends that we can achieve a society of real democracy and political equality without sacrificing liberty by extending democratic principles into the economic order. Although enterprise control by workers violates many conventional political and ideological assumptions of corporate capitalism as well as of state socialism. Dahl presents an empirically informed and philosophically acute defense of "workplace democracy." He argues, in the light of experiences here and abroad, that an economic system of worker-owned and worker-controlled enterprises could provide a much better foundation for democracy, political equality, and liberty than does our present system of corporate capitalism.},

This article offers a new perspective from which to assess the viability of this approach to black empowerment: the supply side of redistricting. Using a unique data set from the 1972, 1982, and 1992 congressional elections in black districts, we examine how individual politicians respond to the changing electoral context imposed by new district lines and how, in turn, their decisions shape the electoral choices and outcomes in a given district. We argue that individual politicians acting in their own self-interest may tip the balance of electoral power to black and white moderates in the district. We find that this outcome prevails in approximately half of the new districts electing candidates who embody a "politics of commonality." This finding runs counter to the fear of the Supreme Court and others that new minority districts promote "political apartheid."},

We argue that the preferences and actions of local election officials (LEOs) differ depending on whether they are elected or appointed. We test these expectations with a data set that includes the survey responses of 1,200 Wisconsin LEOs, structured interviews, census data, and returns from the 2008 presidential election. Drawing upon a natural experiment in how officials are selected, we find that, compared to appointed officials, elected officials express greater support for voter access and expressless concern about ballot security and administrative costs. For appointed officials, we find that voter turnout in a municipality is lower when the LEO's self-reported partisanship differs from the partisanship of the electorate but only in cases where the official is a Republican.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Political scientists have devoted considerable attention to the ways in which economic power can be translated into political influence. Yet there has been little empirical research capable of confirming or denying general hypotheses about the political implications of various aspects of economic structure. This article seeks to begin filling this gap by first identifying five aspects of economic structure likely to affect an industry's political influence (firm size, industry size, market concentration, profitability, arid geographic dispersion) and then testing these aspects by analyzing how well they account for variations among industries in their success at securing public policies of benefit to them, especially in two policy arenas: federal corporate income taxes and state excise taxes. What emerges most clearly from this analysis is an empirical confirmation of the popular hypothesis linking firm size to political influence with respect to both federal corporate tax policy and state excise tax policy. Beyond that, we find reasonably strong negative relationships between political influence and market concentration, profitability, and industry size – the latter lending interesting support to Mancur Olson's argument about the political disabilities of large groups. In the process, the article suggests a potentially fruitful new way to get beyond the case study approach in studying the impact of economic power on political influence, and thus a way to bring to bear more powerful methodological tools on this central issue of modern democracy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Despite recent claims that such behavior has become more widespread in recent years, political consumerism has not been studied systematically in survey research on political participation. Through the use of a pilot survey conducted among 1015 Canadian, Belgian, and Swedish students, we ascertain whether political consumerism is a sufficiently consistent behavioral pattern to be measured and studied meaningfully. The data from this pilot survey allow us to build a “political consumerism index” incorporating attitudinal, behavioral, and frequency measurements. Our analysis of this cross-national student sample suggests that political consumerism is primarily a tool of those who are distrustful of political institutions. However, political consumers have more trust in other citizens, and they are disproportionately involved in checkbook organizations. They also tend to score highly on measures of political efficacy and post-materialism. We strongly suggest including measurements of political consumerism together with other emerging forms of activism in future population surveys on political participation.},

We conduct both aggregate and individual-level statistical analyses of voter turnout in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections. The results show that Election Day registration has a consistently positive effect on turnout, whereas the most popular reform—early voting—is actually associated with lower turnout when it is implemented by itself. We propose that early voting has created negative unanticipated consequences by reducing the civic significance of elections for individuals and altering the incentives for political campaigns to invest in mobilization.},

Results: We show that accommodation is influenced strongly by strategic concerns-including the size of the majority conference coalition, the ideological distance of the author from the majority coalition, the ideological heterogeneity of the conference majority coalition, and the positions taken by majority coalition members and by nonstrategic factors, including the author's workload and the complexity of a case.},

We find that, depending on whether programs are sponsored by industry, environmental groups, or a government, they have strikingly different incentives to grade or compete. Industry sponsors are indifferent about both; environmentalist sponsors optimally grade or compete with other environmentalist sponsors only if consumer preferences for green consumption are skewed in a specific way; and government sponsors׳ decisions depend on the relative importance of private vs. public benefits generated by the green market. We find also that it is no accident that green markets frequently have an environmentalist program competing with an industry one.

The model illuminates a central tension between the congestion externality familiar from conventional club theory and the free-riding externality familiar from the theory on private provision of public goods. We compare three common program sponsors—governments, industry, and environmental groups. We find that if monitoring of the club standard is perfect, a government constrained from regulating club size may prefer to leave sponsorship to industry if public-good benefits are sufficiently low, or to environmentalists if public-good benefits are sufficiently high. If monitoring is imperfect, an important question is whether consumers can infer that a club is too large for its standard to be credible. If they can then the government may deliberately choose an imperfect monitoring mechanism as a way of regulating club size indirectly. If they cannot then this reinforces the government's preference for delegating sponsorship.},

abstract = {Although public agencies must mutually coordinate climate policy and other complex environmental issues, the extent and relative importance of informal networks and different dimensions of trust to the process remains underresearched. Addressing this, we conducted surveys and interviews with civil servants from numerous agencies and three levels of government working on climate change–related policy in the state of New York. We examined the effect of two network properties on mutual learning on climate change–related issues: the extent to which interagency communication takes places through formal and informal channels, and the distribution of two dimensions of trust (“fair play” and “relational comfort”) across the network. Our analysis revealed that formal communication among staff at different agencies was utilized more often than informal and that interagency relationships were more characterized by a feeling of “fair play” than by “relational comfort,” yet informal communication and Relational Comfor...},

To probe the prospects and limits of this shift toward eco-consumerism as a mechanism for global change, this article analyzes its value for improving forest management globally. It reveals that eco-consumerism is improving some aspects; yet, for both supply and demand-side reasons, the advances are incremental and unequal and overall doing little to slow deforestation. The article therefore highlights the danger of overestimating the potential of voluntary eco-certification and advances a set of policy and management solutions to enhance the effectiveness of eco-consumer initiatives such as forest certification. Solutions include internal incremental adjustments to certification programs, coordinated alongside more fundamental external systemic changes in the marketing, industrial use, and valuation of the world's forests.},

This has crucial implications for our collective ability to see and address the ongoing processes of social and environmental destruction under capitalism. This article examines one effort to lift the veil obscuring the relations and processes of commodity production. Fair trade attempts to make visible the social and environmental relations of production and exchange that lie behind the commodity.

We overcome these challenges by conducting survey experiments on both voters and state legislators that show (1) that scholars have underestimated the impact of the party valence brand's potential role in elections, (2) that legislative party leaders pressure members more on votes when the outcome affects the party valence brand, and (3) that the value of the party brand can sometimes directly affect legislators' votes. Our results provide a rationale for why legislative leaders put so much effort into media spin battles and suggest that parties' reputations affect legislative leaders' ability to pass their agenda.},

We formulate an institutionally rich rational-choice model of legislative politics in which the sequence of the legislative process is given special prominence. Committees, as agenda setters in their respective jurisdictions, are able to enforce many of their policy wishes not only because they originate bills but also because they get a second chance after their chamber has worked its will. This occurs at the conference stage in which the two chambers of a bicameral legislature resolve differences between versions of a bill.

That the last two decades have seen some of the least productive Congresses in recent history is usually explained by the growing ideological gulf between the parties, but this explanation misses another fundamental factor influencing the dynamic. In contrast to politics through most of the twentieth century, the contemporary Democratic and Republican parties compete for control of Congress at relative parity, and this has dramatically changed the parties' incentives and strategies in ways that have driven the contentious partisanship characteristic of contemporary American politics.

We study this potential using structural topic models (STMs), a method used for identifying the latent topical dimensions of texts and assessing the effects of covariates on these dimensions. We apply STMs to a corpus of 6298 State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (1977–2012), identifying a plausible set of topics including killings and disappearances, freedoms of expression and movement, and labor rights, among others. We find that these topics vary markedly both over time and space. We also find that while US domestic politics play no systematic role in shaping topic prevalence, US allies tend to receive more attention to violations of physical integrity rights. These results challenge extant research, and illustrate the usefulness of STM methods for future study of foreign policy documents. Our findings also highlight the importance of topical attention shifts in documents that monitor and evaluate countries.},

States are likely to desire forward-looking behavior among judges because it can protect judicial legitimacy, help states to control policy, and could be more efficient than myopic behavior. Using a recent innovation in matching called covariate-balancing propensity scores, we find that the U.S. Supreme Court is equally likely to review and reverse decisions by judges regardless of their selection or retention methods. These results suggest that state supreme court justices, no matter their paths of getting to (and staying on) their courts, are roughly equal in terms of forward-looking behavior.},

We seek to answer long-standing questions about the influence of money in Congress by exploiting a congressional procedure (committee exile) that exogenously varies a member's influence over the policy-making process. We leverage exile as an identification strategy to show that business interests seek short-term access to influential legislators. Industries overseen by the committee decrease contributions to exiled legislators and instead direct their contributions to new committee members from the opposite party. Partisan interests, in contrast, attempt to influence electoral outcomes—boosting contributions to exiled members. Together, we provide evidence that corporations and business PACs use donations to acquire immediate access and favor—suggesting they at least anticipate that the donations will influence policy.},

Especially in recent years, this has led many observers to question the importance of the presidency and bureaucracy to the real work of American governance and the extent to which political actors in the executive branch generally exercise power. This narrative of congressional dominance has been particularly bolstered by recent scholarly interest in principal-agent models of interbranch relations. The assumption of congressional centrality, however, obscures many important features of American politics. Over the course of American history, institutional development in particular has often been driven by either autonomous executive action or conflicts between Congress and the executive. We develop an approach for assessing executive power in institutional politics and illustrate the logic of executive influence with three cases: the rise of federal food-and-drug and forestry regulation, and the growth of the federal farm extension service in the early twentieth century; the rise of the national security state in the mid-twentieth century; and the evolution of budgeting and spending practices over the course of the twentieth century.},

Constitutional Convention revises our understanding of the founders' original intentions for the durable framework that has structured American political development. The Constitution is the by product of expedient accommodations forced on Madison. Madison sought broad national authority independent of state governments and a swift victory for population-based congressional representation. Delegates from economically disadvantaged states opposed these plans, seeking instead to nationalize only selective public goods, to maintain most state policy autonomy, and to minimize contingencies imposed by other governments. Connecticut's delegates, particularly Roger Sherman, played a pivotal role in spoiling Madison's agenda and altering his substantive plans for Constitutional design. Madison's Convention opponents are responsible for a Constitution that nationalized only enumerated public goods and imposed potentially high transaction costs on any further nationalization of policy authority. They helped make federalism a lasting political weapon used to win substantive policy outcomes.},

@article{March1998,
abstract = {The history of international political orders is written in terms of continuity and change in domestic and international political relations. As a step toward understanding such continuity and change, we explore some ideas drawn from an institutional perspective. An institutional perspective is characterized in terms of two grand issues that divide students of international relations and other organized systems. The first issue concerns the basic logic of action by which human behavior is shaped. On the one side are those who see action as driven by a logic of anticipated consequences and prior preferences. On the other side are those who see action as driven by a logic of appropriateness and a sense of identity. The second issue concerns the efficiency of history. On the one side are those who see history as efficient in the sense that it follows a course leading to a unique equilibrium dictated by exogenously determined interests, identities, and resources. On the other side are those who see history as inefficient in the sense that it follows a meandering, path-dependent course distinguished by multiple equilibria and endogenous transformations of interests, identities, and resources. We argue that the tendency of students of international political order to emphasize efficient histories and consequential bases for action leads them to underestimate the significance of rule- and identity-based action and inefficient histories. We illustrate such an institutional perspective by considering some features of the coevolution of politics and institutions, particularly the ways in which engagement in political activities affects the definition and elaboration of political identities and the development of competence in politics and the capabilities of political institutions.},

Using data drawn from 388 individuals, I employ an innovative survey research design approach-anchoring vignettes-to measure political efficacy during rulemaking, as well as a randomized survey experiment to study causal drivers. Despite powerful arguments associated with low efficacy, participants report, on average, "a lot of say" during rulemaking. However, experimental evidence suggests that participants believe agencies are more responsive to business interests than to those of ordinary citizens. When taken together, these results imply notable efficacy among those who participate. However, this normatively optimistic finding is tempered by the normatively pessimistic perception that business interests hold a clear advantage over the general public in influencing agency policy decisions.},

These lines of research, however, have often portrayed interest groups as actors with indirect influence (who, for example, work through or with Congress), rather than assessing the direct influence of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs. I conduct a test of direct interest group influence by analyzing an original data set composed of 1,444 interest group comments in reaction to forty federal agency rules. I find, contrary to the expectations of the extant literature, that the formal participation of interest groups during rulemaking can, and often does, alter the content of policy within the "fourth branch" of government. I conclude that those who voice their preferences during the notice and comment period rulemaking are often able to change government policy outputs to better match their preferences.},

I study the development of 38 health-related regulatory policies in Wisconsin to assess this argument. I employ government records, survey data from more than 350 individuals, and interviews with 15 state policymakers. I find that invisible and visible lobbyingwhen performed in combinationare associated with greater regulatory policy change. From a normative perspective, these results are both reassuring and troubling. On one hand, the results suggest that invisible lobbying, on its own, rarely drives state regulatory policy shifts. Yet, on the other hand, those interested parties with the resources necessary to lobby across multiple modes are more likely to see policy change.},

By considering the actions of policy entrepreneurs--political actors who promote policy ideas--we can gain important insights into the process of policy innovation and innovation diffusion. Policy entrepreneurs constitute an identifiable class of political actors. Their presence and actions can significantly raise the probability of legislative consideration and approval of policy innovations. Event history analyses of the determinants of legislative consideration and approval of an idea for education reform--school choice--in the 48 contiguous United States from 1987 through 1992. The data set consists of unique information collected in a mail survey of members of the education policy elite in each state, augmented with published statistics. Policy entrepreneurs were identified as advocates of school choice in 26 states. While controlling for rival hypotheses, the presence and actions of policy entrepreneurs were found to raise significantly the probability of legislative consideration and approval of school choice as a policy innovation. These results suggest policy entrepreneurs should be given more attention in the literature on policy innovation diffusion.},

abstract = {As arguments about the effectiveness of ''muddling through'' have proven frustratingly inconclusive, incrementalism-once a major approach to the study of boundedly rational policy processes-has gone dormant. In an attempt to revitalize the debate, I present a formal model of muddling through. The model, by clarifying the logical structure of the informal theory, presents a clearer target for criticism. More importantly, it establishes numerous deductive results. First, some of Lindblom's less controversial conjectures-about the benefits of seriality (repeated attacks on the same policy problem) and redundancy (multiple decision makers working on the same problem)-turn out to be correct if conflict across policy domains is absent or takes certain specified forms. But given other empirically reasonable types of conflict, even these claims are wrong. Second, the advantages of incremental (local) policy search (Lindblom's best-known and most controversial claim) turn out to be still less well founded: in many empirically plausible contexts the claim is invalid.},

This was attributed to the stability of policy coalitions in equalibrium until that equilibrium was “punctuated”—generally by some force exogenous to the policy system. One implication of punctuated equalibrium theory is that policy change tends to coincide with institutional change.},

abstract = {Scholars generally agree that interest groups are active and at times influential during the notice and comment period of regulatory policymaking (or "rulemaking"). But current research often ignores the agenda setting that may take place during the pre-proposal stage of rulemaking. During proposal development, interest groups may lobby to: (1) influence the content of proposed regulations or (2) block items from the regulatory agenda altogether. This article focuses on ex parte lobbying-"off the public record" conversations in which lobbyists share policy and political information with regulators-during the preproposal stage of rulemaking. I assess the importance of ex parte influence with data from a content analysis of government documents drawn from seven federal government agencies and a telephone survey of interested parties. Overall, the findings provide the first empirical confirmation that "off the record" lobbying can, and at times, does matter to regulatory content changes during a stage of the American policymaking process that is often overlooked by scholars and the public: the pre-proposal stage of agency rulemaking.},

abstract = {The term 'governance' is popular but imprecise. It has at least six uses, referring to: the minimal state; corporate governance; the new public management; 'good governance'; socio-cybernetic systems; and self-organizing networks. I stipulate that governance refers to 'self-organizing, interorganizational networks' and argue these networks complement markets and hierarchies as governing structures for authoritatively allocating resources and exercising control and co-ordination. I defend this definition, arguing that it throws new light on recent changes in British government, most notably: hollowing out the state, the new public management, and intergovernmental manage-ment. I conclude that networks are now a pervasive feature of service delivery in Britain; that such networks are characterized by trust and mutual adjustment and undermine management reforms rooted in competition: and that they are a challenge to governability because they become autonomous and resist central guidance.},

This article begins to unpack the conditions under which the bureaucracy responds to its stakeholders during rule making, and it is argued that bureaucratic responsiveness is conditioned on the level of attention provided by Congress and the President. This argument is tested with a dataset of forty rules and 1,444 interest group comments. Interest group influence is found to be constrained by congressional - but not presidential - attention to rule making. The results also shed light on Wilson's interest group theory of politics and suggest that the fragmentation of group preferences is less important than the central message sent by groups.},

abstract = {James Madison argued in Federalist 10 that "rival political factions" work against the public good. In contrast to Madison's pessimistic account, I suggest that factional conflict can lead to more representative public policy, and thus further the will of the people. I theorize that elected officials often seek a safe political position-one that corresponds to the preferences of the public at large-during periods of high conflict. I assess this theory in one, salient policy area, medical malpractice. I measure conflict with contributions for state candidates given by (i) the health and insurance industries, which generally support malpractice laws, and (ii) lawyers, who frequently oppose the laws. I find that group conflict matters to policy outcomes. I also find evidence that, under conditions of elevated conflict, adopted policies are more likely to move toward the general ideological preferences of the public at large. These results suggest that group conflict affects both the quantity and character of policy in the American states.},

abstract = {While a number of scholars have examined citizens' satisfaction with specific encounters with government agencies, few studies have assessed explanations of the public's overall evaluations of bureaucratic performance, especially accounts that address sources of variation over time. We address this gap with a new annual time series measure of aggregate assessments of the US federal bureaucracy. We find that public approval of bureaucratic performance varies markedly over time. We then test a number of prior explanations for this movement focusing on both broad contextual forces in the political environment and more specific variables more closely associated with the federal bureaucracy. While data limitations preclude developing a fully specified model tapping all of the explanations simultaneously, we are able to rule out a wide range of 'usual suspects' as free standing or sufficient accounts of variations in aggregate bureaucratic approval over time. But we also isolate a number of promising explanations.},

abstract = {Do health and health policy professionals (HHPPs) participate in the formation of agency health regulations? Passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 has necessitated the writing of many health-related national and state regulations. This article examines the participation patterns of HHPPs during rulemaking to gain insights that may be transferable to future health-related administrative decision making. The author suggests that the mix of public participants active during rulemaking has implications for health policy outputs. This proposition is tested using data drawn from 39 state health regulations and survey data from more than 380 participants and 23 interviews with agency officials. The author finds that HHPPs participate across the majority of the sample regulations, and when their activity across a rule increases, so does participant satisfaction with regulatory outcomes. More broadly, the results suggest a desire for even greater participation by HHPPs in future health-related rulemaking.},

abstract = {Proponents of devolution often claim that the decentralization of policymaking authority to sub-national governments generates better outcomes because decision-making takes place "closer to the people". Yet, the theoretical rationale for why devolution might improve outcomes often remains unspecified. We unpack this argument by formally stating one causal relationship that is often left implicit-devolution leads to experimentation, learning by administrators, and better policy outcomes. We then offer an exploratory empirical examination of this argument. We utilize data collected after the decentralization of welfare-related policymaking authority to local leaders in one American state, North Carolina. We employ case studies, survey research, and budgetary data from 1998 to 2003. Our findings suggest that while some experimentation did occur as a result of devolution, local officials in North Carolina rarely replicated policy decisions that led to improved outcomes in their communities. We conclude that a key argument used to advance policy devolution across a number of countries and political regimes is in need of reevaluation and, potentially, revision.},

abstract = {Work by Axelord, Hardin, and Taylor indicates that problems of repeated collective action may lessen if people use decentralized strategies of recipority to induce mutual cooperation. Hobbe's centralized solution may thus be overrated. We investigate these issues by representing ongoing collective action as an n-person repeated prisoner's dilemma. The results show that decentralized conditional cooperation can ease iterated collective action dilemmas - if all players perfectly monitor the relation between individual choices and group payoffs. Once monitoring uncertainty is introduced, such strategies degrade rapidly in value, and centrally administered selective incentives become relatively more valuable. Most importantly, we build on a suggestion of Herbert Simon by showing that a hierarchial structure, with reciprocity used in subunits and selective incentives centrally administered, combines the advantages of the decentralized structure and centralized solutions. The hierarchical form is more stable than the decentralized structure and often secures more cooperation than the centralized structure. Generally, the model shows that the logic of repeated decision making has significant implications for the institutional forms of collective action.},

This chapter provides an account that claims ideas were present in both the US and UK but Keynes ideas were not adopted equally. Why?

"If the availability of ideas is to be rescued as a potential influence on policy innovation, we must look beyond the simple presence of innovative ideas to probe the routes by which some ideas become influential in different national settings (56)."

"This will require us to examine the way different administrative arrangements at the national level facilitate or discourage innovation and to consider the role of individual national leaders, assessing the extent to which choices among policies are structures for them and to what extent choices are the product of strategic choices made by political leaders (56)."

Notes that a coalition model does a poor job in explaining the origins of keynes-base economic policies

The US - UK comparison "highlight the fact that social group position may not translate into similar policy positions across national boundaries. If we want to make sense of the roles that social interests played in accepting or rejecting Keynesian policies, we must study more closely the meaning of these policies in each national setting, not simple assume policy preferences on the basis of 'objective' economic interests (58)."

Overall she is arguing that the institutional context matters for which innovative ideas find fertile soil in different national settings.

"The institutional arrangements for policy making play a critical role in impeding or facilitating the entry of innovative ideas into policy. Patterns of recruitment to administrative posts and procedures governing advancement are both critical factors in determining whether innovative ideas will emerge within national bureaucracies. When recruitment is governed by rigid guidelines that emphasize conformity to established civil service norms, bureaucrats are more likely to display attachment to standard procedures and established policy positions than a willingness to strike out in innovative policy directions. Likewise, a hierarchical pattern of authority reflected in a tightly controlled information flow within individual bureacracies and in the relationship between political and administrative officials will reduce the possibilities for innovative policy proposals to reach the centers of decision making."

"A contrasting pattern of administration, characterized by flexible standards of recruitment that allow individual departments to bring in outsiders whose career advacement is not tied to existing procedures, provides a much more hospitable setting for innovative policy proposals. The prospects for innovation are further enhanced when the relationship between political officials and administative agencies is not controlled by hierarchical arrangements that serve to restrict the flow of information from various levels of the bureaucracy to political decision makers. Numerous competing centers of advice, however, may prevent the emergence of an authoritative center for policy recommendations, making early advances in policy innovation difficult to consolidate."

"Administative arrangements may facilitate or stifle the emergence of innovative ideas, but without the acquiescence of important social groups, these innovations are unlikely to endure. Thus, building coalitions of support for particular policies is the second process needed to produce lasting policy innovation. To make sense of the position of a social or economic group around a particular policy issue, we need to look beyond the economic interests of individual groups: policy preferences are not simply a reflection of economic interests but rather represent a choice among an array of alternatives. A single policy is unlikely to be judged simply on its own terms; rather it will be considered as part of a constellation of policies that seem to be related."

"To understand the potential of different policies to attract support, we must accordingly examine the range of alternatives under consideration at any one time and assess how a particular policy is politically packaged with other policies. We must, moreover, examine the way the policy in question is related, or appears to be related, to past policies. Social interests may reject or approve policies depending on past experiences with similar measures or with policies that appear similar (60)."},

Notes

From research for Tuohy. This is a good article to read. Has the latest stuff and looks at the idea of policy creating politics. Could be good for my theoretical chapter.


Brings up Esping-Anderson under the section on Feedback Effects on Mass Publics (p. 605):

"Esping-Andersen's detailed investigation of social policy and occupational structures in the United States, Sweden, and Germany persuasively links public policy structures to the socieconomic circumstances of mass publics. Emerging variations in the rate of growth of service industries, the relative weight of social services as opposed to personal servcies, the skill and occupatoinal composition of the labor force, and the distribution of jobs by gender and racial or ethnic background can all be traced in part to previous policy choices. What The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism does not do in more than a cursory way is investigate how these shifts in the circumstances of mass publics influence political processes. But the importance of the transformations Esping-Anderson identifies suggests that such an investigation would probably yield rich returns."},

abstract = {Political scientists have paid much more attention to the effects of institutions than to issues of institutional origins and change. One result has been a marked tendency to fall back on implicit or explicit functional accounts, in which the effects of institutions explain the presence of those institutions. Institutional effects may indeed provide part of such an explanation. Yet the plausibility of functional accounts depends upon either a set of favorable conditions at the design stage or the presence of environments conducive to learning or competition. Exploring variability in the relevant social contexts makes it possible to both establish the restricted range of functional accounts and specify some promising lines of inquiry into the subject of institutional origins and change.},

abstract = {"Microeconomic theory can serve at least two useful functions in the development of a coherent theory of political economy. First, the logic of individual choice is developed in detail. Second, microeconomic theory may provide a useful framework for the analysis of the economic interests of social actors. While the formal theory of social choice has received considerable development in political science, there is considerably less research explicitly endogenizing political decisions. This paper examines a recent body of research by economists which does attempt to link rational choice with explicit assumpitons about economic interests in an attempt to endogenize tariff policy. It is suggested that this line of research is potentially fruitful, but that greater attention needs tos be given to the institutional assumptions on both thedemand and supply sides of the market for political outputs."},

She provides three examples of bias resulting from selection on the dependent variable. One involves studying only those cases in which the outcome of interest has actually taken place. If trying to determine why the outcome happened, must also study places where it has not. The second involves the causes of revolution and illustrates the importance of either randomly or systematically assuring wide variation in the cases selected. The third involves dangers in selecting the endpoints in time-series studies.

Definitely recommend this one.},

@article{Howlett2007,
abstract = {Abstract: The new orthodoxy in studies of policy dynamics, including those of Baumgartner and Jones, Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, and Hall, is that policy change occurs through a homeostatic process. “Perturbations” occurring outside of an institutionalized policy subsystem, often characterized as some type of societal or political upheaval or learning, are critical for explaining the development of profound and durable policy changes which are otherwise limited by ‘endogenous' institutional stability. These homeostatic assumptions, while useful for assessing many cases of policy change do not adequately capture the historical patterns of policy development found in many sectors. The roots of this problem are traced back to the origins of the new orthodoxy in comparative policy research whereby different levels (orders) of policymaking have been incorrectly juxtaposed, providing a parsimonious, but sometimes empirically incorrect, view of policy change. Revising existing taxonomies of policy levels provides a superior identification of the processes of change, and uncovers more than one mechanism through which significant policy change can occur. Three of these alternative mechanisms - a “neo-homeostatic” one in which paradigmatic changes occur through endogenous shifts in goals; a ‘quasi-homeostatic' in which exogenous factors influence changes in objectives and settings; and a ‘thermostatic' one in which durable policy objectives require that settings adapt to exogenous changes - are discussed.},

Yet movement participation has become increasingly popular as a form of political action. The authors seek to resolve this dilemma by distinguishing between three arenas of movement success: changing policy, gaining participation in the policy process, and changing social values. It issuggested that gaining access to the policy process is the most effective path for movement organizations to have an impact on policy outcomes, because authorities are often more willing to offer inclusion in the process than they are to accept movement demands for policy change. The authors' hypotheses are examined in light of the experience of the nuclear freeze movement, which sought and failed to achive policy change, and the movement to control hazardous wastes, in which environmentalists are having an impact on policy by gaining participation in regulatory and implementation decisions."},

This article uses empirical evidence accumulated from case studies of four prominent Canadian federal policy sectors over the period 1990-2000 to address this issue. It sets out a model that explains policy changeas dependent upon the effects of the articulation of ideas and interests in public policy processes, and generates several hypotheses relating different subsystem configurations to propensities for paradigmatic and intra-paradigmatic policy dynamics. It suggests that the identification of the nature of the policy subsysten in a given sector reveals a great deal about its propensity to respond to changes in ideas and interests.},
