  The concept of environmental justice has become a dominant frame for environmental policy agenda in the US federal government. Administrations from both parties have shifted attention from society-wide benefits and costs of environmental policy to the distribution of benefits and costs, both for regulation and industrial policy. However, as concepts of justice rooted in grass-roots advocacy and academia collide with the opportunity structure of federal policymaking and implementation, the term "environmental justice" has gained new meanings, including definitions rejected by most activists and absent from academic writing. While the adoption of environmental justice discourse is evidence of the movement's impact on policymaking, the new meanings of the phase make it difficult to assess the movement's impact on substantive policy outcomes. 
  
  Disaggregating the meanings of environmental justice can help us understand the puzzling consistency with which the term is used across presidential administrations and the large differences in the success of campaigns organized by different groups under the banner of environmental justice. Specifically, I take up three questions: (1) is the adoption of EJ rhetoric related to substantive policy change?; (2) how should we interpret these changes?; and (3) why are some groups more successful than others? 
  
  Analyzing the text of over 10,000 draft and final rules from 52 agencies and millions of public comments on these rules from 1993 to 2024, I build an empirically-rooted taxonomy of environmental justice claims made in the policy process, track changes in usage by advocates and policymakers over time, and assess the relationship between different types of claims and policy change. Leveraging within-organization variation in efficacy across multiple lobbying attempts, I find that when organizations successfully mobilize environmental justice issue frames (i.e., policymakers adopt environmental justice language after an organization pressures them to), they are more likely to achieve their substantive policy aims. However, this effect is mostly driven by large national advocacy organizations adopting environmental justice rhetoric to advance more traditional environmental policy agendas, not by the kind of environmental justice activists that social movement scholars write about. Moreover, the environmental justice frame is being used by advocates and policymakers to justify deregulatory policies as advancing economic development, including promoting timber harvesting and fossil fuel sector employment. This "cooption" partially explains consistency in the term's use across administrations. These findings highlight the importance of tracking changes in meanings and measuring substantive policy outcomes for assessing the impact of social movements on policy and policy implementation.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}


Long marginalized in the US environmental movement, the concept of environmental justice (EJ) has become a near-dominant frame for the environmental policy agenda in the US federal government [@EO14096]. EJ was the dominant frame for environmental policy advanced both by President Biden ("Joe's Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice") and now Vice President Harris ("A Climate Plan For the People") as they sought the Democratic Party's nomination.  Even strong critics of government regulation presume that EJ analysis will continue to shape policy in future Republican administrations [@2025, p. 441].
  
This frame---historically uniting various critics of mainstream utilitarian environmentalism around unequal distributions of environmental harms and amenities---has found a fit with policy agendas as both parties have shifted from basing policy proposals on society-wide benefits and costs toward a greater focus on the distribution of benefits and costs, both for regulation and, increasingly, industrial policy.  @Taylor2002 describes a fusion of the American Indian Movement, Chicano movement, farmworker movement, civil rights movement, and union organizing: 

> People of color [raised] social justice concerns such as self-determination, sovereignty, human rights, social inequality, loss of land base, limited access to natural resources, and disproportionate impacts of environmental hazards and linked them with traditional working-class environmental concerns such as worker rights and worker health and safety to develop an environmental justice agenda. (p. 1)

Like other movements, the EJ movement illustrates how groups attempt to use a particular way of framing policy issues (in this case, a particular phrase) as a vehicle to build coalitions and advance policy agendas. The original members of this coalition---activists fighting racialized geographies of environmental harms, settler colonialism, and hazardous working conditions---continue to organize under the environmental justice banner. But as it has gained political legitimacy, other groups increasingly frame their struggles as matters of environmental justice. 

As concepts of justice rooted in grass-roots advocacy and academia collide with the opportunity structure of federal policymaking and implementation, environmental justice has gained new meanings. These changes include academics and activists linking issues such as GMO labeling [@Gonzalez2011], police violence [@Pellow2016], cosmetics [@DiCosmo2024], the location of parks [@Boone2009], the location of dollar stores [@Kavi2019], homelessness [@Gamble2023], COVID-19 [@Dean2022], science policy [@Desikan2023], light pollution [@Xiao2023] garbage collection [@Bell2013], plastic pollution [@Kefela2024], knowledge of earthquake risk [@Reddy2023], and anything related to climate change [@Resnik2022], including renewable energy development [Whyte2023] <!--Green House Gasses [CITE]--> to the environmental justice movement. These changes also include opponents of environmental regulation adopting definitions rejected by most activists and absent from academic writing. Both efforts to expand and coop the environmental issue frame are evidence of its power and legitimacy in environmental policymaking.

Issue definition matters because the mobilization or suppression of conflicts allocates power---" antagonists can rarely agree on what the issues are because power is involved in the definition" [@Schattschneider1975]. Changes in issue definition frequently precede major policy changes [@Baumgartner1993]. 

While the adoption of environmental justice discourse is evidence of the movement's impact on policymaking discourse, the new and contested meanings of the phase make it difficult to assess the movement's impact on substantive policy outcomes because meaning may not be shared between policymakers and activists, or even among activists [@Lester2001]. 

To systematically examine the impact of advocacy on policy, I focus on US federal agency rulemaking. Environmental justice is relevant to agency rulemaking in particular due to President Clinton's Executive Order 12898---"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations"---directing all agencies to consider EJ implications of their actions and policies. Executive Orders or statements from agency heads in every administration have since interpreted and reinterpreted parts of EO 12898, all with direct implications for rulemaking.^[
While EO 12898 does not itself create a right to sue agencies, courts may strike down rules for failing to comply with procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) if the agency fails to "examine the relevant data" or "consider an important aspect of the problem" (*Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.*, 1983). This can include an agency's 12898 EJ analysis: "environmental justice analysis can be reviewed under NEPA and the APA" (*Communities Against Runway Expansion, Inc. v. FAA*, 2004).] 
Despite this Executive Order, not all draft or final rules address EJ. Those that do, however, tend to cite EO 12898 and use the phrase "environmental justice." For the same reason, commenters who critique draft rules also cite EO 12898 and use this language. Again, this is true both for movement activists and reactionary efforts to redefine the term.

In prior work, I show that environmental justice advocacy is associated with agencies adding EJ language and changing how they discuss it. However, these effects are driven by large national advocacy groups, not frontline EJ groups  [@ej]. These findings invite three further questions that I take up in this paper: (1) is the adoption of EJ rhetoric related to substantive policy change?; (2) how should we interpret these changes?; and (3) why are some groups more successful than others? The first and third questions require hand-coding a large number of documents related to advocacy campaigns and their success or failure in achieving the substantive policy changes they sought. The second and third questions require a taxonomy of different kinds of environmental justice claims raised by advocates or adopted by agencies. This taxonomy allows us to better interpret the impact of advocacy and assess whether unequal levels of success are related to group characteristics or the kind of environmental justice they seek. 
  
  Analyzing the text of over 10,000 draft and final rules from 52 agencies and 50 million public comments on these rules from 1993 to 2024, I build an empirically-rooted taxonomy of environmental justice claims made in the policy process, track changes in usage by advocates and policymakers over time, and assess the relationship between different types of claims and policy change.
  
  
  Leveraging within-organization variation in efficacy across multiple lobbying attempts, I find that when organizations successfully mobilize environmental justice issue frames (i.e., policymakers adopt environmental justice language after an organization pressures them to), these organizations are more likely to achieve their substantive policy aims. However, this effect is mostly driven by large national advocacy organizations adopting environmental justice rhetoric to advance more traditional environmental policy agendas, not by the kind of environmental justice activists that social movement scholars write about. <!-- Ironically, definitions of environmental justice that align least with those traditionally used by activists and discussed in academic literature are most associated with policy change. --> 
  
  The meanings of environmental justice raised by policy advocates vary widely. Beyond the original focus on environmental racism, advocates raising perceived environmental injustices now include almost any inequality across space (including differences across jurisdictions, urban and rural communities, and proximity to various kinds of infrastructure and (dis)amenities) or demographic identity group (including race, gender, age, income, sector of employment, native language, culture, and disability status). 
  
  These findings highlight the importance of tracking changes in meanings and measuring substantive policy outcomes for assessing the impact of social movements on policy and policy implementation.


# Data

To systematically assess how often the environmental justice frame is used in federal rulemaking and what it means when it is, I first collect a dataset of all 14,938 draft and final rule pairs published from January 2005 through August 2024 \[Note: @fig-ej-data totals for 2024 are partial year totals\] by all 52 agencies that published at least one rule addressing environmental justice.^[Because I focus on whether rules address commenter demands, I exclude proposed rules that were not finalized and final rules that were published without first taking comments on a draft.] Of these, 3291 proposed rules and 4,738 final rules discuss the environmental justice implications of the rule. I also collect all public comments on these rules. 24,362 unique comments (excluding mass comment and petitioning campaigns) mention "environmental justice." 

 @fig-ej-data shows the rates of mentioning environmental justice for the primary time period for these data. 

```{r fig-ej-data, fig.cap = "Final Rules by Whether they Address Environmental Justice"}

```




# Puzzle 

As shown in @fig-ej-data, the rates of US federal agencies addressing environmental justice in final rules (as mandated by EO 12898) are low and surprisingly consistent across Republican and Democratic administrations, with similar, variation in the corresponding proposed (draft) rules. Thus, it is not simply a matter of public pressure forcing Republican administrations to match Democrats. Indeed, 

Controlling for the scale of public pressure (*Log(Unique EJ Comments)*) and agency (Fixed effects in models 1 & 2, and each agency's prior *Ratio* of rules addressing EJ in models 3 & 4), responsiveness to demands to address EJ from public comments (*EJ Comment*) did not vary significantly across most administrations from G.W. Bush through Obama and Trump. Biden has slightly higher rates of responsiveness but no more than the Clinton administration.  
@tbl-ej-tables show estimates from a series of logit regression models predicting whether the agency will add text addressing EJ to a final rule when the draft rule did not mention EJ at all. Using estimates from Model 1 to predict responsiveness to commenters requesting that EJ be addressed at two agencies across administrations, @fig-ej-m-PR-pres shows surprisingly similar rates of responsiveness to comments raising (i.e., the difference between adding EJ text to final rules when comments raised it and minus baseline rates of adding EJ text.)

```

Consistency in mentions of environmental justice across administrations could have at least four different explanations: 

1. Discussion of environmental justice in final rules could be cheap talk, pro forma compliance with EO 12898, unrelated to substantive policy agendas
1. Presidential administrations could have different definitions of environmental justice that reframe it in a way that is consistent with their policy agenda. This would allow the term to be used with similar frequency despite different meanings. 
1. The phrase environmental justice may be used in ways that are less correlated with partisanship than its historic roots in environmental racism discourse. 
1. Presidents do not perfectly control bureaucratic agents. The persistence of engagement (or non-engagement) with 

These explanations are not mutually exclusive, and each may explain a portion of the lack of variation.

The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025: Mandate for Leadership report does not propose simply eliminating the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, as it does with many agencies and offices. Instead, it suggests that the staff be reallocated to the Office of the Administrator and to be run by a political appointee [@2025, p. 421] and Office of the General Council and that EJ work should continue but be "based on
neutral constitutional principles" [@2025, p. 441] 

> [T]here is an opportunity to redefine EJ as a tool for the agency to prioritize environmental protection efforts and assistance to communities in proximity to pollution or with the greatest
need for additional protection. Allocations of agency resources increased
EPA enforcement and/or agency distribution of grants should be based on
neutral constitutional principles" [@2025, p. 441] 

This could be consistent with several explanations: former (and possible future) Trump Administration officials could simply be aiming to assert control over the office in order to suppress its influence over policymaking, or they may have a different definition of EJ and want to make sure that the office is advancing their preferred issue frame.  

Definitions are contested among both activists and policymakers. 
For example, @Lester2001 find that activists repeatedly succeeded in legitimizing their claims and getting EJ concerns on the political agenda but largely failed to push through legislation, in part due to conflicts between grassroots and national advocacy groups (p. 52)

# Methods 

## Hand-codeing

To investigate the relationship between issue framing and substantive lobbying success, I use hand-coded comments on a random sample of 200 [182/200 complete as of Sept 1, 2024] rulemaking dockets. For each rule in the sample, almost all comments are hand-coded for their level of lobbying success. Hand-coding includes recording the type of organization, the lobbying coalition to which each comment belongs, the type of coalition (primarily public or private interests), their policy demands, and the extent to which the change between the draft and final rule aligned with their demands. This level of alignment between policy demands and policy outcomes is my measure of lobbying success. It does not identify a causal relationship (true policy influence), but it is the standard approach for assessing lobbying success with these kinds of observational data [see @Yackee2006JOP]. For a more detailed description of the coding process, the codebook is available in Appendix @sec-codebook.^[
  I developed software and methods to select comments that were most likely submitted by organizations rather than by individuals. For example, I include all comments submitted as file attachments or emails, but only some comments typed in a text box. Sophisticated lobbying organizations almost always submit comments as file attachments. I include comments typed in a text box if they share text with other comments, indicating they are part of a pressure campaign. This includes nearly all comments on most rules. I exclude entirely unique textbox contents and comments shorter than ten words. Most textbox comments and nearly all extremely short comments are trivial (e.g., "This sucks"). While form letters are often short, they are very unlikely to be less than ten words. For comments sharing text, I code one sample document for all versions of the form letter. 
]
The hand-coding process included identifying the organization responsible for each comment submitted by an organization (e.g., a business, nonprofit, or government). 

This sample of rules includes `r nrow(comments_coded %>% distinct(agency, president))` agencies, including all 52 agencies that have published at least one rule addressing environmental justice and eight agencies that have received comments requesting them to address environmental justice but have never done so. 
The hand-coded sample of comments on these rules includes `r nrow(comments_coded)` hand-coded documents representing over `r (sum(comments_coded$comments)/1000000) %>% round(0)` million comments (including both mass comments and the `r nrow(comments_coded)` sophisticated comments they support), including 179 comments from Native American Tribes and 78 from frontline EJ groups. 

### Substantive Policy Change and Lobbying Success

My approach to measuring lobbying success starts with policy demands raised in comments. The dimensions of conflict on which I judge lobbying success are those issues identified by commenters. Unlike other studies, the issues I use to assess lobbying success do not come from first reading the policy or of any a priori concept of what each policy fight is about. Instead, I read the change between draft and final rule with an eye for alignment with commenters' requests (including requests that specific parts of the draft policy do not change.)

Other approaches to identifying the commenter's relationship with policy changes have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, one could measure success by the number of times a comment is mentioned in the agency's response to comments. However, this measure may be affected by strategic responsiveness by agencies choosing to discuss some issues more than others. It also counts explicit rejections toward the measure of responsiveness (as I show in @sec-dim, explicit rejections are common). One could also measure success by focusing on a priori potential aspects of the policy. @Balla2020 count five factors: (1) the number of regulated entities, (2) the number of activities or substances being regulated, (3) the level of pollution standards, (4) the compliance and effective deadlines of the regulation, and (5) the monitoring and reporting requirements. Each takes one value (increasing or decreasing), and each is weighted equally in their analysis. In contrast, by starting with comments, my method relies on commenters to define the dimensions of conflict and highlight the issues they care most about. In this sense, because I am interested in how explicit issue framing affects lobbying success, my approach focuses on  "the first face of power"---issues that are already on the agenda of the broader policy system [@Bachrach1963].   <!--TODO CLARIFY-->



### Summary statistics


@tbl-ej-winrates shows relative rates of lobbying success for different types of organizations. "Overall Success Rate" shows the share of cases that changed between draft and final as each type of commenter requested. "EJ Success Rate" shows the share of cases that changed as the commenter requested when the comment's demands were coded as related to environmental justice. Some organization types --- including frontline EJ community groups, universities, religious groups, professional associations, environmental groups, and pressure groups --- are subsets of the broad "NGO" category. Trade associations, while technically nonprofit, are not included in the NGO category.  

```{r}
#| label: "tbl-ej-winrates"


load(here::here("data", "winrate.Rdata"))

winrates %>% 
  mutate(`EJ Success Rate` = `EJ Success Rate` %>%
           percent(accuracy = 1) %>% replace_na("-"),
         `Overall Success Rate` = `Overall Success Rate` %>%
           percent(accuracy = 1)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-`N raising EJ`) %>%
  # name to nest
  mutate(`Organization Type` = `Organization Type` %>% 
           str_replace("(State|Tribe|City)", "Government, \\1") %>% 
           str_replace("(Religious|Pressure Group|Professional Assn.|University|Environmental Group|Credit Union|Union|Frontline EJ)", "NGO, \\1") %>% 
           str_replace("(Finance|Law Firm)", "Business, \\1") %>% 
           str_replace("(NGO$|Business$)", "\\1 (Overall)")) %>% 
arrange(`Organization Type`) %>% 
  kable3(caption = "Hand-coded Lobbying Success by Type of Organization, 2005-2020")
```

Only law firms were more likely to get their substantive policy demands met when their comments raised EJ concerns. Tribes and Frontline EJ community groups---already the types of organizations least likely to have their substantive demands met (9% and 4%, respectively)---saw none of their substantive demands related to EJ met. NGOs, overall, and environmental groups (a subset of NGOs) were slightly less likely to see their policy demands met when these demands were explicitly linked to EJ. The most successful types of organizations overall---Trade Associations, States, Cities, and Banks---did not use EJ language in the hand-coded sample. 
Because EJ demands often oppose the status quo, this aligns with 
<!--the findings of Chapter @influence and -->
research shows that advocating for the status quo is one of the strongest predictors of lobbying success [@Baumgartner2009].
This should not be taken as evidence that tribes and frontline groups are never influential. Rare events---like comments raising EJ concerns on rules that did not address EJ---are not captured by this small random sample of rules.

@tbl-ej-winrates raises an additional question:  are agencies less responsive to tribes and frontline EJ groups *because* they are marginalized in the policy process *or* because their demands are more difficult to accommodate? For example, is a mainstream environmental group asking for more safety regulations related to Uranium mining more likely to be successful than a Native Tribe making the same request? Or are the observed differential lobbying success rates a result of these groups asking for different things? For example, the mainstream environmental group is asking for more safety regulations, but the Tribe is asking for regulatory authority over mining affecting tribal lands to be returned to Tribal governments (a request that an agency of a settler government may be perceived as less legitimate and thus be less likely to grant). 



## Priors 

While my coding of dimensions of environmental justice is largely inductive, I started with some expectations of dimensions of environmental justice based on prior work. 

Most prominent is the distinction between distributive and procedural justice. 
Procedural justice is discussed both in terms of ex-ante inclusion in policy processes and ex-post matters of equity in implementation and enforcement [@Boone2008].
For example, @Konisky2017 find that regulatory enforcement is correlated with political mobilization around EJ issues.

Another dimension of variation is racialization. Modern environmental justice advocacy has roots in the older organizing frame of environmental racism. While the movement has broadened, racial inequality still features prominently in activism and scholarship. Policies' exclusion of race is a frequent target of activist pressure. 
@Abel2015 find that poorer and less White states have more developed EJ policies.

Additionally, distributive justice claims operate at different geographic scales.
A major difference between national advocacy groups and more traditional EJ groups was the scale of impacts they addressed. Traditional groups commented on global or national averages of harms and benefits that were presumed to benefit marginalized communities most harmed by pollution. 
In contrast, local groups tended to focus on more targeted policies (e.g., state implementation plans or air quality attainment zones). Even when commenting on national policies, they cited specific impacts in their area. This is especially true for tribes and other Native groups.

# Findings

## Policymakers Engaging with Environmental Justice is correlated with Substantive Policy Success {#sec-cor}


@tbl-mo1ej and @fig-mo1ej show the results of a difference-in-difference regression predicting hand-coded lobbying success *within* organizations that lobbied on more than one rule. *Pressure campaign* indicates whether the organization mobilized a public pressure campaign. The coefficient is negative in this model because pressure campaigns are associated with highly salient rules where agencies are, on average, less likely to make changes [@ej]. *Supports Rule* indicates whether the commenter supports the direction the agency is going. In this case, the organization's policy demands are pushing the agency to go further or posing "friendly" amendments. This is highly associated with lobbying success (p < .001). *Agency Adopted EJ* Frame indicates whether the agency changed how it addressed EJ after receiving comments raising EJ concerns. This coefficient alone simply suggests that organizations are, on average, more successful when the agency makes changes (p < .001)---it is not specific to the organization's demands. *Business* is whether the commenter is a business. *Business x Agency Adopted EJ Frame* is the coefficient on the interaction term. Businesses may fare slightly worse when agencies change how they address environmental justice compared to non-businesses (p < .1).

```


Because models with interaction terms are difficult to interpret, @fig-mo1ej presents predicted lobbying success for the most common business group, The American Petroleum Institute, and the most common non-business group, The Sierra Club, in these data under two conditions: when the agency adopts new EJ language after commenters raise EJ concerns and when EJ language is unchanged in the final rule. There is a weak suggestive relationship between the agency adopting new EJ language and the Sierra Club having more lobbying success.

## Emerging Dimensions of Environmental Justice Frame {#sec-dim}

In this section, I inductively identify salient dimensions of environmental justice raised in public comments. <!--Inequalities are correlated.--> 

::: {.callout-note}
I have not finished coding these documents, so this qualitative section is very sparse and preliminary.
:::

### Spatial 

Many environmental justice claims have to do with the unequal spatial distribution of environmental harms. Commenters assert an extremely wide variety of spatially disparate impacts as matters of environmental justice. 


#### Unequal spatial distribution of impacts

One of the major evolutions from its origins in environmental racism is a great expansion of the groups claiming to be disproportionately affected. It no longer needs to assert marginalization or historic oppression. Commenters assert injustices when one county is impacted more than another if urban areas are impacted more than rural areas, or vice versa. 

For example, a rural county in Oregon claimed that logging restrictions due to endangered species conservation increased the risk of wildfires, which disproportionately impact rural communities: 

> Smoke from such wildfires substantially impacts public health. These serious health impacts are an environmental justice issue that many rural counties throughout Oregon face because of the federal government’s failure, or inability, to responsibly manage forests due, in large part, to unnecessary and/or unwarranted restrictions that all center around the spotted owl... [(Douglas County, 2008)](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FWS-R1-ES-2020-0050-0539)


#### Hotspots 

One class of spacial problem is when standards regulate averages across a geography or allow averaging or trading across pollution sources. In these cases, certain areas can become "hot spots," where the standards are exceeded but averaged or offset with other places that fall below the standard to achieve legal compliance. 

For example, commenters often raise environmental justice concerns when to pollution sources that affect them are averaged or purchase offsets from more distant sources, meaning that the closer source will pollute more than it would have if each source was required to meet the standard alone. 

#### Unequal baselines 

Some commenters take inequalities in exposure to environmental harms to argue that any average reduction in pollution that affects large areas will disproportionately benefit EJ communities and thus count as advancing environmental justice. This argument is frequently made by mainstream national advocacy groups to advance policies based on their general impacts rather than paying specific attention to localized impacts.

### Identities

In addition to geographic-based inequality, commenters raised many inequalities linked to identities, including race, gender, and age. One of the most common identity groups, however, was sector of employment. Comments citing occupations with high exposure to environmental harms often ended up in my sample because they uploaded The President’s Cancer Panel report as an attachment. This report links sectors of employment to exposure to carcinogens and defines it as an environmental justice issue: 

>  People from
disadvantaged populations are more likely
to be employed in occupations with higher
levels of exposure (e.g., mining, construction,
manufacturing, agriculture, certain service
sector occupations) and to live in more highly
contaminated communities. The reality of
this unequal burden is not just a health issue,
but an issue of environmental justice. While all Americans now carry many
foreign chemicals in their bodies, women
often have higher levels of many toxic and
hormone-disrupting substances than do
men...Children of all ages are considerably more
vulnerable than adults... [(The President’s Cancer Panel)]()

This report was cited as a reason to limit workplace exposure in a wide range of policy areas agencies, including Centers for Medicare&Medicaid Services policy on electronic health records [WorkSafe, 2012](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2012-0022-0414) and changes to Livestock and Poultry Practices required to be certified Organic by the Agricultural Marketing Service [(Frank Kleinke, 2018)](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/AMS-NOP-15-0012-61822).


#### Gender and Age

#### Language and culture

Language and culture overlap with specific geographies, especially with Native lands. Native commenters frequently assert harm to certain locations as harm to their culture.

### Cumulative Impacts 

While typically focused on multiple geographically proximate impacts, cumulative impacts referrers to many things. A classic example is how permitting decisions for a facility should account for nearby facilities that impact the same area. However, a call to address cumulative impacts may also include background sources of pollution (e.g., naturally occurring or historic persisting). For example, it can refer to adding up exposure at home and at work. 

#### Cumulative similar impacts

> The rule also does not involve special consideration of environmental justice-related issues as required by EO 12898.”


#### Cumulative disparate impacts 

Airport noise


### Procedural injustice 

In the hand-coded sample, commenters raised procedural justice issues on policies about procedures, especially reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act, which proscribes how other agencies conduct environmental reviews. 


Overlapping with the focus on NEPA, many of the procedural justice claims came from tribes asserting consultation rights. CEQ-2019-0003-84724
CEQ-2019-0003-171251
CEQ-2019-0003-169898

### Enforcement 

While procedural and enforcement injustices get significant attention in academic texts, advocates in the rulemaking process rarely raise concerns about enforcement. This is likely due to the forum, which is soliciting comments on draft policy, leading people to focus on substance. 

## Environmental Justice Frames As Recognized by Policymakers

In this section, I disaggregate the frames used or recognized by agency officials as they respond to public comments and revise the final rule documents. 


### Comments missed or ignored 

As suggested by the response in @fig-ej-m-PR-pres, most agencies, most of the time failed to respond to commenters raising environmental justice concerns. Sometimes, this was because the EJ concerns cited were only loosely connected to the rule---for example, the above-mentioned report on unequal exposure to cancer risk is only loosely related to organic farming practices and medical records systems. 

However, it is not uncommon for agencies to completely miss substantive comments raising clear EJ concerns; for example, during the Obama administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission published new Emergency Preparedness Regulations [NRC-2008-0122](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/NRC-2008-0122/unified-agenda). In the final rule, they claim to have received no input on environmental justice. 

> The NRC requested public comments on any environmental justice considerations that may be related to this rule and no comments were received. 

This was incorrect. A comment from Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. raised serious EJ concerns that went unaddressed in the rule:

> The rules and guidance are based on a fantasy world in which the terrain around nuclear power stations is perfectly flat, radiation plumes do not move up and down, the wind blows at the same speed in a constant direction throughout an accident, and most people follow the instructions they are given about the need to evacuate.

> **Need for Site-Specific Analysis of Transport-Dependent Populations:** The present guidance suggests that because 50% of residents would offer rides to those in need, approximately 50% of the transit-dependent population in the EPZ would rideshare. Criteria for Development of ETE Studies (April 23, 2009) at 13. This assumption fails to account for the likely separation of transit-dependent environmental justice populations from more affluent populations. Furthermore, it takes no account of attitudes towards race and the potential reluctance of whites to offer rides to African- Americans. Instead of presuming that 50% of the transit-dependent population will rideshare, the presumption should be that only a small percentage will rideshare unless the licensee can show that there are no geographical concentrations of transit-dependent populations and that there is no racial or sociological bias with regard to ridesharing.

> ...people would be foolish to follow the directions of first responders if they are based on totally unrealistic modeling. Indeed, it is doubtful whether people would follow instructions even if they were based on the best predictions possible. The experiences during Hurricane Katrina also underline that it is even more doubtful whether the response planned for environmental justice communities would actually materialize.



### Ways that Agencies Dismissing EJ Claims


#### Empty lipservice 

As one commenter noted on the Trump Administration's NEPA reforms: 

> We find that many pages of most NEPA
disclosure documents are devoted to boilerplate language regarding historic preservation;
environmental justice,... and other issues. [(Oregon Wild, 2020)](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CEQ-2019-0003-161185)

Boilerplate language asserting "no adverse effects on low-income or minority populations" was common in regulatory texts. However the frame is understood by the bureaucrats using this language, it is clear that they do not understand environmental justice analysis as part of their job. 


#### Minimizing policy impacts relative to trends

When the Trump Environmental Protection Agency repealed the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, the EPA asserted that any climate-related benefits of the policy were insignificant because the trend was toward decreasing pollution intensity. Because the trend was in the right direction, the future was to be better than the past, and thus, comparative analysis of alternative futures with and without the policy is not needed. 

> EPA believes that the power sector is already on the path to achieving the CO2 reductions required by the CPP. Therefore, the EPA does not believe it would have any significant impact on EJ-affected communities. [(EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0355, 2019)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/08/2019-13507/repeal-of-the-clean-power-plan-emission-guidelines-for-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-existing)

The Biden EPA used a similar logic, emphasizing that while the relative impact of the policy would be to increase pollution, broader downward trends meant that exposure would still be lower in the future (though not as low as it would be under the prior policy regime): 

> ...there is potential for some geographic areas and demographic groups to experience small increases in ozone concentrations relative to the baseline levels, which are projected to be substantially lower than today's levels. [(EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0072-8244, 2024)](https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0072-8244)


#### Balancing 

For example, the Trump administration's repeal of the Clean Power Plan noted that the policy would lead to increased pollution in some areas but argued that they were offset by improvements in other areas: 

> While the EPA expects areas in the southeastern US to experience a modest increase in fine particle levels, areas including the Midwest will experience reduced levels of PM, yielding significant benefits in the form of fewer premature deaths and illnesses. On balance, the positive benefits of this action significantly outweigh the estimated disbenefits.


This kind of large-scale averaging that allows local pollution hot spots has been one of the main complaints of environmental justice advocates from the beginning of the movement. 


#### Citing limits on harms 

Another genre of response aims to address concerns by emphasizing that the policy limits the level of inequality it might permit. For example, the Biden EPA addressed complaints that emissions trading could lead to pollution hot spots but asserted that the policy included backstops intended to limit inequalities: 

> The EPA is cognizant of these concerns and believes that emission trading and averaging are not necessarily incompatible with environmental justice. The EPA is including limitations on the use of compliance flexibilities in state plans that should help address these EJ concerns.

When weakening or repealing regulations, agencies often cite other policies as backstops that minimize the harms of removing federal regulation. For example, the Bush EPA claimed that deregulating sources of hazardous air pollution would have no effect on nearby minority and low-income communities because polluters were still required to have a plan, just not required to follow it.

> "The only difference from current regulation is that the source is not required to follow the plan." 

### "Job-killing" regulation as an environmental justice issue

When the Trump Administration repealed the Clean Power Plan (CPP) regulations on power plants (Electric Generating Units or EGUs), the Trump EPA advanced an argument that, despite harming air quality, the repeal served environmental justice because it preserved jobs and lowered utility bills in low-income communities near power plants. This section of the proposed rule on environmental justice then went on to link job loss to health risks and substance abuse: 

> Low-income and minority communities located in proximity to EGUs may have experienced an improvement in air quality as a result of the emissions reductions. However, the EPA did not address the potential distribution of compliance costs associated with the CPP...Low-income households typically spend a greater share of their household income on energy, and to the extent that this action reduces energy costs, those low-income households will experience lower energy bills...While employment effects are not experienced uniformly across the population and may be offset by new opportunities in different sectors, localized impacts could have adversely affected individuals and their communities... In addition, past research has suggested that involuntary job loss may increase risks to health, substance abuse, and even mortality. [(EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0355, 2017)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/16/2017-22349/repeal-of-carbon-pollution-emission-guidelines-for-existing-stationary-sources-electric-utility)

<!--## Appendix A: Tracing Ideas Through Rulemaking Records 

### Rules where the proposed rule did not address EJ, but comments did, and the Final Rule did.


EPA-R09-OAR-2010-0120	Revisions to California State Implementation Plans: Imperial County Air Pollution Control District:

>"EPA agrees it is important to consider environmental justice in our actions, and we briefly addressed environmental justice principles in our proposal TSD. (171) ..." 

BUT "Environmental Justice" does not appear in the PR, and THERE IS NO OTHER TECHNICAL SUPPORTING DOCUMENT ON REGULATIONS.GOV. FOOTNOTE 171 REFERENCES THE PROPOSED RULE.

> This action will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority, low-income, or Tribal populations because it increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, including any minority or low-income population. In particular, EPA's limited approval and limited disapproval of Regulation VIII would have the effect of strengthening environmental requirements throughout ICAPCD and would not relax environmental requirements in any area. Thus it promotes environmental justice by increasing the level of human health and environmental protection for an area where, **as the commenters note, relatively large portions of the population are low income and/or minority**."

---

EPA-R05-OAR-2007-0587, Oct 19, 2010, Final Approval of the Wisconsin NOx RACT Rules (NR 428) did not mention environmental justice but recognized a comment that raised hotspot concerns. The agency spent several pages of the preamble to the final rule attempting to rebut the commenter's concerns but did not substantively modify the rule in response. 

> "The commenter also states that multi-facility averaging threatens environmental justice."

EPA-R05-OAR-2010-0034	Final Approval of PM 2.5 Clean Data Determination for Saint Louis: 

> "significant source of PM2.5 emissions in the Saint Louis area, and that the plant's operations raise environmental justice concerns. EPA reviewed air quality data throughout the Saint Louis area, including environmental justice areas."

EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0094:	National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: General Provisions	Impacts

> Response to comments: 

> Comment: One commenter stated that EPA failed to comply with Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice. The commenter asserts that the amendments will adversely affect minority and low-income communities around the sources.

> Response: Executive Order 12898 establishes a Federal policy for incorporating environmental justice into Federal agency actions by directing agencies to identify and address, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income populations. The EPA has considered the impact of the proposal on minority and low-income populations. **We do not believe that these amendments will have any adverse effects** on emissions during periods of SSM. Therefore, there should not be any adverse impact **on minority and low-income populations** as a result of these amendments. The amendments do not affect the underlying requirement to minimize emissions during SSM events. **Owners or operators are still required to develop SSM plans to address emissions** during these periods. They are required to report immediately when the plans are not followed and semiannually when the plans are followed, and emission limitations are exceeded (or could have been in the case of malfunctions) and describe steps taken to minimize emissions. **The only difference from current regulations is that the source is not required to follow the plan**, especially when the situation may call for other action or when safety considerations override following the plan as written.

However, a [comment by Richard Webster & Manna Jo Greene on Behalf of Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc.](https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/NRC-2008-0122-0088) did address EJ:

> The rules and guidance are based on a fantasy world in which the terrain around nuclear power stations is perfectly flat, radiation plumes do not move up and down, the wind blows at the same speed in a constant direction throughout an accident, and most people follow the instructions they are given about the need to evacuate.

Atlantic Highly Migratory Species: Atlantic Shark Management Measures; Final Amendment 5b	NOAA-NMFS-2013-0070	

> We received a total of 76 individual written comments on the proposed rule from fishermen, states, and other interested parties during the public comment period, including one comment from EarthJustice that included signatures from 19,716 individuals and another comment from Oceana that included signatures from 13,144 individuals.

>The EPA submitted a comment recommending additional environmental justice information...and include in the EIS whether the proposed alternatives have any potential for disproportionate adverse impacts to minority and low-income populations. The EPA also recommended that the EIS include the approaches used to foster public participation by these populations and describe outreach conducted to all other communities that could be affected by the project because rural communities may be among the most vulnerable to health risks associated with the project.

> NMFS appreciates these recommendations from the EPA and has added additional information to the environmental justice discussion in Section 9.4 of the FEIS.

Between the time of the proposed rule in 2013 and the final Rule and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in 2017, 

> Executive Order 12898 requires agencies to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse environmental effects of its regulations on minority and low-income populations. To determine whether environmental justice concerns exist, the demographics of the affected area should be examined to ascertain whether minority populations and low-income populations are present. If so, a determination must be made as to whether implementation of the alternatives may cause disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on these populations.
Community profile information is available in the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP (Chapter 9), a recent report by MRAG Americas, and Jepson (2008) titled “Updated Profiles for HMS Dependent Fishing Communities” (Appendix E of Amendment 2 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP), and in the **2015** HMS SAFE Report. The MRAG report updated community profiles presented in the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and provided new social impact assessments for HMS fishing communities along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The 2011 and 2012 SAFE Reports (NMFS 2011 and NMFS 2012) include updated census data for all coastal Atlantic states and some selected communities that are known centers of HMS fishing, processing, or dealer activity. Demographic data indicate that coastal counties with fishing communities are variable in terms of social indicators like income, employment, race, and ethnic composition.
The preferred alternatives were selected to minimize ecological and economic impacts and provide for the sustained participation of fishing communities. The preferred alternatives would not have any effects on human health, nor are they expected to have any disproportionate social or economic effects on minority and low-income communities.

They also cited research published in the same year as the draft rule:

>Jepson and Colburn (2013) developed social indicators of vulnerability and resilience for 25 communities in the US southeast and northeast regions selected for having a greater than average number of HMS permits associated with them.

Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska: Chinook Salmon Bycatch Management in Bering Sea Pollock Fishery	NOAA-NMFS-2010-0032

>Comment 79: NOAA has the responsibility to modify the Council's recommendations to fulfill Federal obligations under ANILCA, ESA, Pacific Salmon Treaty, Environmental Justice, and Federal responsibility to tribal governments. NOAA should fulfill these obligations by not implementing Amendment 91 and insisting on the smaller bycatch rates proposed and supported by the most directly impacted communities.

>Response: NMFS has complied with all applicable laws, Executive Orders, and international obligations in approving and implementing Amendment 91, as documented in the EIS and ROD (see ADDRESSES).

> Comment 96: Subsistence users of the Yukon River, the vast majority of whom are Alaska Native and have the lowest per capita income in the United States,  are clearly bearing a disproportionately high adverse environmental impact under Amendment 91. Under the concept of Environmental Justice, why does Amendment 91 result in tribal subsistence users bearing virtually all of the consequences resulting from past, present, and future wasteful bycatch by the pollock fleet? This violates all measures of fairness and fails to satisfy any consideration of environmental justice. The pollock fleet can best afford to make sacrifices in order to accomplish meaningful reductions in Chinook salmon bycatch.

> Response: NMFS acknowledges the comment. The EIS prepared for this action analyzes the environmental justice impacts of this action (see ADDRESSES).

EPA-R05-OAR-2020-0055
Removal of Ohio Nuisance Provision (3745-15-07) final rule	

>OAC 3745-15-07 [Ohio State Law] prohibits the “emission or escape into the open air from any source or sources whatsoever, of smoke, ashes, dust, dirt, grime, acids, fumes, gases, vapors, odors, or any other substances or combinations of substances, in such manner or in such amounts as to endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, or cause unreasonable injury or damage to property.”

> On March 23, 2020, the EPA proposed, under the authority of section 110(k)(6) of the CAA, to remove Ohio's nuisance rule from the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) because it does not have a reasonable connection to the attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) and EPA erred in approving it as part of the Ohio SIP.

> Comment 10: Commenters state that the NPRM would harm already vulnerable Ohioans by eliminating an important **environmental justice** tool. Commenters also raised concerns about the potential impact on other sensitive populations, such as children, the elderly, and individuals with various health issues, including respiratory illnesses.

> Response: The purpose of this rulemaking action is to remove OAC 3745-15-07 from the Ohio SIP because it is not related to the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the NAAQS. This rulemaking action does not invalidate the Ohio law or affect its applicability to Ohio sources. **Facilities located in Ohio are still subject to the state nuisance rule.** EPA supports programs and activities that promote enforcement of health and environmental statutes in areas with minority populations and low-income populations and the protection of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations.

<!--
The Forest Service (FS) has by far the highest predicted baseline rate of adding EJ to rules. This may be because the forest service is mainly in
the business of managing forests, leasing timber rights, and controlling
wildfires. These types of decisions have acute distributional
effects. Forest Service rule-writers may also simply have an institutional practice of addressing E.O.12898. 
Similarly, the Federal
Railroad Administration,  Federal Highway
Administration Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration all have large baseline rates of adding EJ to final rules. These agencies make decisions about infrastructure projects with implications for
neighborhood environments and air quality. Environmental justice may
often come up.
Research agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), also have a low but significant baseline rate of adding EJ to final rules.

 @fig-ej-m-PR-pres showed surprisingly similar rates of responsiveness to comments raising (i.e., the difference between adding EJ text to final rules when comments raised it and minus baseline rates of adding EJ text.)
@fig-ej-m-PR-president and @fig-ej-mejPR-president show these same results but include point estimates for the baseline condition (adding or changing EJ language when comments did not raise EJ) and the treatment condition  (adding or changing EJ language when comments did raise EJ). They show low baseline rates of adding EJ language when it was not present in the proposed rule but much higher rates of changing EJ language when it was present in the proposed rule. In all cases, comments raising EJ concerns are associated with a higher rate of addition or change, respectively, across administrations.
