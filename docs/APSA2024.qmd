## Preview 

1. Large-analysis of *all* 15,000 draft and final rules from 52 agencies 2005-2024 <br>             & 40,000,000+ public comments $\uparrow$ 

- puzzlingly little variation over time in baseline **rates** of addressing EJ *and* **responsiveness** to requests to do so

. . . 

2. Medium-scale sample of all comments on 200 rules 

- adding EJ language may correlate with substantive policy change favoring public interest groups
- mostly Big Greens using generic EJ language
- different meanings across administrations 






##  Little variation in baseline **rates** of addressing EJ


```{r fig-ej-data, fig.cap = "Proposed and Final Rules by Whether they Address Environmental Justice"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "ej-data-6.png") ) 
```

##  Little variation in **responsiveness** to comments raising EJ

```{r}
#| label: fig-ej-m-PR-pres
#| fig-cap: "Responsiveness to Pressure Address Environmental Justice where the Proposed Rule Did Address Environmental Justice"
#| out-width: 50%

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "ej-m-PR-president-median-pres-1.png") ) 

```


## Motivation

> "Similarities across administrations in baseline rates of considering EJ and responsiveness to public pressure mask radically different definitions of environmental justice advanced by each administration...

> Future research should assess the relationship between distinct types of EJ claims and corresponding policy changes."

### Getting policymakers talking about climate & EJ

From 2005 to 2020

- 8% of relevant agency rules addressed climate change, 15% mentioned EJ 

- 20% of all public comments mentioned climate change, 12% mentioned EJ 

- 1000 supporters = ~ 65 percentage point increase in the probability that the agency addresses climate change, 46 percentage point increase that the agency addresses EJ 

- Responsiveness is surprisingly stable across administrations but varies wildly across agencies
