## Preview: **Part 1**

 Large-scale analysis: *all* 15,000 draft and final rules from 52 agencies 2005-2024 & 50,000,000+ public comments on these draft rules

- agencies add EJ language when pressured
- puzzlingly little variation over time in baseline **rates** of addressing EJ *and* **responsiveness** to requests to do so

## Preview: **Part 2** 

Medium-scale hand-coded sample of all 11,000 comments from organizations on 200 rules 

- adding EJ language may correlate with substantive policy change favoring public interest groups ("lobbying success")
- mostly Big Greens using generic EJ language
- radically different meanings of EJ across commenters and administrations

###  Little variation in **rates** of addressing EJ


```{r fig-ej-data, fig.cap = "Proposed and Final Rules by Whether they Address Environmental Justice"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/ej-data-6.png") 
```

---

###  Little variation in **responsiveness** to comments

```{r}
#| label: fig-ej-m-PR-pres
#| fig-cap: "Responsiveness to Pressure Address Environmental Justice where the Proposed Rule Did Not Address Environmental Justice"
#| out-width: 100%

knitr::include_graphics("figs/ej-m-PR-president-median-pres-2.png") 

```


## Part 2: Motivation

> "Similarities across administrations in baseline rates of considering EJ and responsiveness to public pressure mask radically different definitions of environmental justice advanced by each administration...

> Future research should assess the relationship between distinct types of EJ claims and corresponding policy changes."

## How to interpret advocacy group adoption/cooption of EJ rhetoric

- expanding and contested frame: 

  - any inequality across space or identity group


## How should we interpret agency adoption of EJ rhetoric

- Mostly rebutting or dismissing complaints (most officials do not understand EJ analysis as part of their job)

- But, some meaningful policy changes under all presidents

- But, mostly non-targeted policy advanced by historically white national advocacy groups (e.g., pollution limits, safety, public lands, marine sanctuaries)

- But, some targeted policy (catch limit exemptions, tribal consultation)

### Getting policymakers talking about climate & EJ

From 2005 to 2020

- 8% of relevant agency rules addressed climate change, 15% mentioned EJ 

- 20% of all public comments mentioned climate change, 12% mentioned EJ 

- 1000 supporters = ~ 65 percentage point increase in the probability that the agency addresses climate change, 46 percentage point increase that the agency addresses EJ 

- Responsiveness is surprisingly stable across administrations but varies wildly across agencies
