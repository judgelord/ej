>" Silarities across administrations in baseline rates of considering EJ and responsiveness to public pressure mask radically different definitions of environmental justice advanced by each administration...

> Future research should assess the relationship between distinct types of EJ claims and corresponding policy changes."

### Getting policymakers talking about climate & EJ

From 2005 to 2020

- 8% of relevant agency rules addressed climate change, 15% mentioned EJ 

- 20% of all public comments mentioned climate change, 12% mentioned EJ 

- 1000 supporters = ~ 65 percentage point increase in the probability that the agency addresses climate change, 46 percentage point increase that the agency addresses EJ 

- Responsiveness is surprisingly stable across administrations but varies wildly across agencies
